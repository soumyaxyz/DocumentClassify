Following are some known external aids, which are admissible for
the interpretation of statutory provisions:
(1) Parliamentary material

(a) Debates

Courts often take recourse to parliamentary material like debates
in Constituent Assembly, speeches of the movers of the Bill, Reports of
Committees or Commission, Statement of Objects and Reasons of the
Bill, etc. As per traditional English view, these parliamentary material or
Hansard were inadmissible as external aids, on the basis of ‘exclusionary

?

rule’. This “exclusionary rule” was slowly given up and finally in Pepper

v_Hart, (1993) 1 ALLER 42 (HL), it was held that parliamentary material

 

or Hansard may be admissible as an external aid for interpretation of a
statute, subject to parliamentary privilege, under following
circumstances; where (a) legislation is ambiguous or obscure or leads to
an absurdity; (b) the material relied on consists of one or more
statements by a minister or other promoter of the Bill, together, if
necessary, with such other parliamentary material as is necessary to
understand such statements and their effect; and (c) the statements

relied on are clear.

Indian Courts, in early days followed the ‘exclusionary rule’ which
prevailed in England and refused to admit parliamentary material or
Constituent Assembly debates for the purpose of interpretation of

statutory or constitutional provision (see State of Travancore- Cochin and

 

others v Bombay Co. Ltd., AIR 1952 SC 366; Aswini Kumar Ghose and
another v Arbinda Bose and another, AIR 1952 SC 369. However, in

 

subsequent cases, the Supreme Court relaxed this ‘exclusionary rule,
much before the law laid down in England in ‘Pepper’ case. Krishna Iyer
J. in State of Mysore v R.V. Bidop, AIR 1973 SC 2555, quoted a passage
from Crawford on Statutory Construction (page 383) in which

exclusionary rule was criticized. The relevant passage is quoted below:-
