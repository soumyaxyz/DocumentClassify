“In the absence of domestic law occupying the field to formulate
effective measures to check the evil of sexual harassment of
working women at all work places, the contents of International
Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of
interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work
with human dignity in Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the
Constitution and the safeguards against sexual harassment
implicit therein. Any international convention not inconsistent
with the fundamental rights and in harmony with its spirit must
be read into those provisions to enlarge the meaning and content
thereof, to promote the object of the Constitutional guarantee.”
