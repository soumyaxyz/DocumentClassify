In the letter of reference, we have extracted a passage regarding
impact of information technology. Merely because the Indian Evidence
Act has been amended by the Information Technology Act, 2000 keeping
in view the advancement of information technology, that should not lead
to amendment of the General Clauses Act, 1897 because the terms
expressed in the amended General Clauses Act will have an all pervasive
impact on the “post-amendment General Clauses Act”, Central

enactments only.

It may suffice to mention that the proposed recommendations
made in the 60t Report for making amendments in the General Clauses
Act, 1897 will be applicable only to new Central statutes enacted after

coming into force of the proposed amending Act and hence there is no

 

possibility of impact of any proposed amending provisions on the existing

 

Central statutes.

The General Clauses Act, 1897 is a consolidation of the General
Clauses Act, 1868 and the General Clauses Act, 1887. The main object
of these Acts as mentioned in the respective preambles of 1868 and 1887
Acts is to shorten the language used in the Central Acts as applicable in
India. Hon’ble Mr. M.D. Chalmers, the then Law Member in the Council
of Governor General, while introducing the Bill for 1897 Act, pointed in
the Council that the new Bill was not intended in any way to change the
existing law. He further stated that its object was simply to shorten the
language of future statutory enactments. (see The Gazette of India, Part

VI pp 35-6 dated Feb., 6, 1897).

Section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is the definition
section. There are sixty six clauses in the said section which give
meaning of words and phrases used in different statutes. The meaning

of the words given in these definition clauses are applicable to this Act of
