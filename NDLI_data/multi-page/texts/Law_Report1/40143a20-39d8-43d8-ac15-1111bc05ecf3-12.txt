which they intended to achieve when they enacted cls (4) and (7)

in their present form.” (para 45)

Again in R.S. Nayak v A.R. Antulay (Supra), the Supreme Court

observed in this regard:

“...Therefore, it can be confidently said that the exclusionary rule is
flickering in its dying embers in its native land of birth and has

been given a decent burial by this Court.” (para 34)

The Supreme Court in a numbers of cases referred to debates in
the Constituent Assembly for interpretation of Constitutional provisions.
Recently, the Supreme Court in S.R. Chaudhuri v State of Punjab and
others, (2001) 7 SCC 126 has stated that it is a settled position that

 

debates in the Constituent Assembly may be relied upon as an aid to
interpret a Constitutional provision because it is the function of the
Court to find out the intention of the framers of the Constitution. (para
33)

But as far as speeches in Parliament are concerned, a distinction
is made between speeches of the mover of the Bill and speeches of other
Members. Regarding speeches made by the Members of the Parliament at
the time of consideration of a Bill, it has been held that they are not
admissible as extrinsic aids to the interpretation of the statutory

provision. (see - K.S. Paripoornan v State of Kerala and others, AIR

 

1995 SC 1012). However, speeches made by the mover of the Bill or
Minister may be referred to for the purpose of finding out the object
intended to be achieved by the Bill (see K.S. Paripoornan’s case ( supra).
J. S. Verma J (as he then was) in R.Y. Prabhoo (Dr.) v. P.K. Kunte,
(1995) 7 SCALE 1 made extensive reference to the speech of the then Law

 

Minister Shri A.K. Sen for construing the word ‘his’ occurring in sub-

section (3) of section 123 of the Representation of People Act 1951.
