the language of a statutory provision is ambiguous, not clear or where
two views are possible or where the provision gives a different meaning
defeating the object of the statute. If the language is clear and
unambiguous, no need of interpretation would arise. In this regard, a
Constitution Bench of five Judges of the Supreme Court in R.S. Nayak v
A.R. Antulay, AIR 1984 SC 684 has held:

“... If the words of the Statute are clear and unambiguous, it is the
plainest duty of the Court to give effect to the natural meaning of
the words used in the provision. The question of construction
arises only in the event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of the

words used in the Statute would be self defeating.” (para 18)

Recently, again Supreme Court in Grasim Industries Ltd. v
Collector of Customs, Bombay, (2002)4 SCC 297 has followed the same

principle and observed:

“Where the words are clear and there is no obscurity, and there is
no ambiguity and the intention of the legislature is clearly
conveyed, there is no scope for court to take upon itself the task of

amending or altering the statutory provisions.” (para 10)

For the purpose of construction or interpretation, the court
obviously has to take recourse to various internal and external aids.
“Internal aids” mean those materials which are available in the statute
itself, though they may not be part of enactment. These internal aids
include, long title, preamble, headings, marginal notes, illustrations,
punctuation, proviso, schedule, transitory provisions, etc. When internal
aids are not adequate, court has to take recourse to external aids. It

may be parliamentary material, historical background, reports of a
