1. Report — A continuum on the General 1-37
Clauses Act, 1897 with special reference
to the admissibility and codification of
external aids to interpretation of statutes

The Law Commission has received a reference dated 28.1.2002
from the Legislative Department, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company
affairs, Government of India for examining the Commission’s 60 Report
on the General Clauses Act, 1897 submitted to the Govt. of India in the
year 1974. The reference specifically seeks the Commission’s view on the
issue whether extrinsic aids should be made admissible in construction
or interpretation of a statute, and if so, whether rules for extrinsic aids
should be codified and incorporated in the General Clauses Act, 1897? It
has been stated in the reference that there has been conflict in judicial
decisions as to the admissibility of extrinsic aids and our courts are not

following uniform approach to principles of statutory construction
