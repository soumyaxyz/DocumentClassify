a law or Act, becomes functus officio, so far as that particular Act

is concerned and it cannot interpret it.” (para 47)

The court further observed:

“Statute being an edict of the Legislature, it is necessary that it is
expressed in clear and unambiguous language. In spite of Courts
saying so innumerable times, the draftsmen have paid little
attention and they still boast of the old British Jingle, I am the
Parliamentary draftsman, I compose the country’s laws. And of half

of the litigation, 1 am undoubtedly the cause...” (para 48)

In another case (Keshav Mills Company Limited v CIT, Bombay
North, AIR 1965 SC 1636), the Supreme Court has observed:

 

“\..It is general judicial experience that in matters of law involving

questions of construing statutory or Constitutional provisions, two

views are often reasonably possible and when judicial approach
has to make a choice between the two reasonable possible views,
the process of decision making is often very difficult and delicate.”

(para 23)

Now, if the rules of interpretations regarding use of external aids
are also provided in legislative form, then these statutory provisions
about external aids may also require interpretation from the court as the
language may bear two views or may be ambiguous. Therefore, the
codification of these rules would not serve any purpose, rather it may
create some more problems of interpretation.

In our country, rules for interpretation in the form of a scientific
system were developed since very early times known as Mimamsa
Principles of Interpretation. These principles were regularly used by our

renowned jurists like Vijnaneshwara (author of Mitakshra), Jimutvahana
