section 77 (1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

The application of this rule of construction has the merit of
avoiding any contradiction between a series of statutes dealing with the
same subject, it allows the use of an earlier statute to throw light on the
meaning of a phrase used in a later statute in the same context. On the
same logic when words in an earlier statute have received an
authoritative exposition by a superior court, use of same words in similar
context in a later statute will give rise to a presumption that the
legislature intends that the same interpretation should be followed for
construction of those words in the later statute. (see Bengal Imunity Co.

normally not used as an aid to construction of an earlier statute, but
when an earlier statue is truly ambiguous, a later statute may in certain

circumstances serve as a parliamentary exposition of the former.

meaning ascribed to its words by contemporary opinion and in case of an
ancient statute, such reference to usage and practice is an admissible
external aid to its construction. But this principle is not applicable to a
modern statute and it is confined to the construction of ambiguous
language used in old statute. This principle of ‘contemporanea exposito’
