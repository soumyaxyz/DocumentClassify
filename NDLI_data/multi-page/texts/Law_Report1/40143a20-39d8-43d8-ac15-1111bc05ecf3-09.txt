The Supreme Court has accepted the necessity of external aids in
interpretation of statutory provision. O.Chennappa Reddy J. in B.
Prabhakar Rao and others v State of A.P. and others , AIR 1986 SC 120

 

has observed :

“Where internal aids are not forthcoming, we can always have
recourse to external aids to discover the object of the legislation.
External aids are not ruled out. This is now a well settled principle

of modern statutory construction.” (para 7)

Recently, in District Mining Officer and others v Tata Iron & Steel
Co. and another , (2001) 7 SCC 358, Supreme Court has observed:

 

 

“It is also a cardinal principle of construction that external aids are
brought in by widening the concept of context as including not
only other enacting provisions of the same statute, but its
preamble, the existing state of law, other statutes in pari materia
and the mischief which the statute was intended to remedy.” (para

18)

So far as admissibility and utility of these external aids are
concerned, law is almost settled in our country now. The Supreme Court

in K.P. Varghese v Income Tax Officer Ernakulam, AIR 1981 SC 1922 has

 

stated that interpretation of statute being an exercise in the
ascertainment of meaning, everything which is logically relevant should

be admissible.
