refused to take recourse to the Report of the special Committee which
had been appointed by the Government of India to examine the provision
of the Partnership Bill for construing the provisions of the Partnership
Act, 1932 in CIT, A.P. v Jaylakshmi Rice and Oil Mills Contractor Co.,
AIR 1971 SC 1015, yet in another case Haldiram Bhujiawala and another

Committee (1930-31) for construing the provisions of section 69 of the
Partnership Act, 1932. The Supreme Court in the above case held that
decision in CIT v. Jaylakshmi Rice & Oil Mills (supra) in this respect is

where a particular enactment or amendment is the result of
recommendations of Law Commission Report. (see Mithilesh Kumari v

external aid for interpretation of statutory provisions.

It is a settled principle that for the purpose of interpretation or

dealing with the same subject matter or forming part of the same system.
Supreme Court in Common Cause, A Registered Society v Union of India,

AIR 1996 SC 3081, took recourse to section 13A and 139 (4B) of the
