(author of Dayabagh), Nanda Pandit (author of Dattak Mimamsa), etc.
Whenever there was any conflict between two Smrities, eg., Manusmriti
and Yagnavikya Smriti, or ambiguity in a Shruti or Smriti, the Mimamsa
Principles were utilized. These Mimamsa rules were laid down by
Jaimini in his Sutras written abound 500 B.C. No doubt, these
principles of interpretation were initially laid down for interpreting
religious texts pertaining to ‘Yagya’ (sacrifice), but gradually the same
principles came to be used for interpreting legal texts also, particularly
since in the Smrities the religious texts and legal texts are mixed up in
the same treatises.

Sir John Edge, the then Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, has

 

referred to the Mimamsa principle in Beni Prasad v Hardai Bibi, (1892)

ILR 14 All 67 (FB).

Similarly, Gunapradhan Axiom of the Mimamsa principle was
applied for interpretation of section 419 of UP Sales Tax Act in Amit
Plastic Industry, Ghaziabad v Divisional Level Committee, Meerut (CM
WP No. 372/1989 decided on Nov.10, 1993). Again in Tribhuwan Mishra
v Distt. Inspector of Schools, Azamgarh (CMWP No. 17554/1990, decided

 

 

on March 30, 1992 ‘Samajasya Axiom’ was applied.
The Supreme Court has also taken note of these ancient principles.

In UP Bhoodan Yagna Samiti, UP v Braj Kishore, AIR 1988 SC 2239); The

 

apex court applied one of these principle after quoting a ‘Shloka’. In this
regard Court observed:
“In this country, we have a heritage of rich literature, it is
interesting to note that literature of interpretation also is very well
known. The principless of interpretation have been enunciated in
various Shlokas which have been known for hundreds of years.”
