Convention is involved, it is obviously desirable that decisions in different
jurisdictions across the world should so far as possible be kept in line

useful for guiding the courts.

(6) Historical facts and surrounding circumstances

 

Apart from the various external aids discussed above, courts while
interpreting a statutory provision, can take into account relevant
historical facts or history of enactment in order to understand the
subject matter of statute. Court can also have regard to the surrounding
circumstances which existed at the time of passing of the statute. But,
like any other external aid, the inference from historical facts and
surrounding circumstances must give way to the clear language
employed in the enactment itself. In this regard, Supreme Court in
Mohanlal Tripathi v._Distt. Magistrate Rail Bareilly and others, (1992) 4
SCC 80, has observed:

 

“Value of ‘historical evolution’ of a provision or ‘reference’ to what
preceded the enactment is an external aid to understand and
appreciate the meaning of a provision, its ambit or expanse has
been judicially recognized and textually recommended. But this
aid to construe any provision which is ‘extremely hazardous’
should be resorted to, only, if any doubt arises about the scope of
the section or it is found to be ‘sufficiently difficult and ambiguous
to justify the construction of its evaluation in the statute book as a
proper and logical course and secondly, the object of the instant
enquiry’ should be ‘to ascertain the true meaning of that part of
the section which remains as it was and which there is no ground
for thinking of the substitution of a new proviso was intended to
