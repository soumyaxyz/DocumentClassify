“Statutes are the expression of the will of an authority constituted
by society to announce general obligatory legal rules. The binding
force of statute law attaches to the formula in which the law is
expressed. The task of interpretation of a statute is of, extracting,
from the formula, all that it contains of legal rules, with a view to
adapting it, as perfectly as possible, to the facts of life. Therefore,
the insertion of rigid rules may go against the very concept of

interpretation.”

A statute is a will of legislature conveyed in the form of text.
Words in any language are not scientific symbols having any precise and

cases by the court. In Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v Price

Waterhouse, (AIR 1998 SC 74) the apex court observed:

 

“Interpretation postulates the search for the true meaning of the
words used in the statute as a medium of expression to
communicate a particular thought. The task is not easy as the
‘language’ is often misunderstood even in ordinary conversation or
correspondence. The tragedy is that although in the matter of
correspondence or conversation the person who has spoken the
words or used the language can be approached for clarification, the

Legislature cannot be approached as the Legislature, after enacting
