Now, the issue arises whether law about admissibility of these
external aids should be incorporated in the General Clauses Act 1897.
This issue was examined by the Law Commission in Chapter 2 of the its
60th Report. The Law Commission was of the view that these rules of
admissibility of external aid cannot be codified. These are judge made

rules. The Commission thus observed as follows:

“2.7 It is obvious that all ‘rules of interpretation’ cannot be
codified. Some rules are only guidelines, as we have already
stated. A suggestion was made later by Professor Acharya in his
Tagore Law Lectures on codification in British India, that the scope
of the General Clauses Act should be extended so as to make it a
comprehensive code on the interpretation of statutes. This
suggestion is, no doubt, attractive at first sight; but a close
scrutiny will reveal its impracticability. It is not possible to
incorporate, in an Interpretation Act, the rules of interpretation
enunciated in the text books on the subject. One of the main
reasons for having an Interpretation Act is to facilitate the task of
the draftsman in preparing parliamentary legislation. The courts
also have recourse to Interpretation Acts to interpret statutes; but
they do not confine themselves to these Acts. They certainly take
the aid of accepted rules of interpretation as laid down in decided
cases.

Moreover, a certain degree of elasticity is necessary in this
branch of the law. Rules of construction of statutes are not static.
Aims and objects of legislation will be better served by appropriate
judicial interpretation of the law, rather than by rigid provisions in
the law themselves. At present, Judges have a certain amount of
latitude in the matter, which enables them to do justice, after
taking into consideration the nature and character of each statute.

If the rules of construction are given a statutory form, the
