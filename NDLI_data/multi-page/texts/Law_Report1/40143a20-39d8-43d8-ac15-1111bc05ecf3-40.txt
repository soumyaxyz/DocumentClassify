operation of the Article 367; and the General Clauses Act, 1897 as
it stood immediately before 26 January, 1950 (subject to

adaptations made under the Constitution) will continue to apply.”

In this background, the Law Commission in its 60t Report
recommended insertion of new section 3 A and section 29A which states
that proposed changes, in the definition section and rules for
construction of Acts etc. would not affect the existing Central Laws and

would apply only to future enactments.

The Law Commission in its 60th Report has suggested few changes
only. The Commission has observed at para 1.26 that the
recommendations given in the report are not numerous or radical. The
provisions of the said Act cause no serious difficulty which may

necessitate any radical change in the Act.

Therefore, the recommendations contained in the 60th Report will
not affect in any way the construction of any enactment which has been
made before the date of implementation of the proposed amendments

suggested in the 60't Report.

The result is, that the most of the changes proposed in the General
Clauses Act 1897 in 60t» Report of the Law Commission will be
applicable only and only to statutes which will be enacted after the
proposed amendments are enforced and not on the existing enactments.
Therefore, the Commission does not consider it necessary to undertake a
fresh review of the aforesaid recommendations contained in the 60th

Report.

We recommend accordingly.
