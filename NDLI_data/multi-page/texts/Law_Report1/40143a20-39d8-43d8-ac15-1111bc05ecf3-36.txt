1897 and all Central Acts and Regulations made after the
commencement of this Act, unless those Acts or Regulation contain
separate definitions of their own or there is something repugnant in the

subject or context. The opening words of section 3 is as follows:-

“3.Definitions — In this Act, and in all Central Acts and Regulations
made after the commencement of this Act, unless there is anything

”

repugnant, in the subject or context, ......

The words, “all Central Acts or Regulation made after the
commencement of this Act”, indicate that definitions provided in this
section would be applicable only to those Acts or Regulations which were
made after 1897. So far as the Acts or Regulations made before 1897,
section 3 would not apply. Therefore, it was held in State of Orissa _v.
Gangadhar Subudhi ILR 1966 Cutt 102 that as the Provincial Small
Causes Courts Act was passed in 1887, hence, definition provided in
section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 does not apply to that Act.
Similarly, Andhra Pradesh High Court in Fatima Fauzia v. Syed-ul-Mulk,
AIR 1979 AP 229 has held that as Trust Act was passed in 1882, the

 

definition of ‘good faith’ given in the General Clauses Act, 1897 is not
attracted to the Trust Act. On the same ground, Allahabad High Court in
Lachmi Prasad v. Lachmi Narain AIR 1928 All.41, also held that

 

definition of ‘good faith’ given in the General Clauses Act, 1897 does not
apply to the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.

The General Clauses Act, 1897 also contains provisions regarding
construction of Acts, Regulation, rules and bye-laws. But these
provisions are applicable only to those Acts, Regulations, etc., which
have been made after the commencement of the General Clauses Act,
1897. So far as the Acts, Regulations etc. made before 1897, are
concerned rules of construction specified in sections 5 to 13 of the

General Clauses Act, 1897 would not apply to those enactments.
