the view that the judicial art of interpretation and appraisal is
imbued with creativity and realism and since interpretation always
implied a degree of discretion and choice, the courts would adopt,
particularly in areas such as constitutional adjudication dealing
with social and defuse (sic) rights. Courts are therefore, held as

”

‘finishers, refiners and polishers of legislation...” (para 15)
Therefore, when the interpretation requires discretion and choice,
it is not advisable to codify the rules for interpretation especially those

regarding use of external aids.

One of the main reasons which requires giving considerable
latitude to courts in the matter of interpretation of statutory provision is
that the Legislature cannot foresee exhaustively all the situations and
circumstances that may emerge after enacting statutory provisions where
their applications may be called for. It is impossible even for the most
imaginative Legislature to foresee all the future circumstances. In this
regard, Supreme Court in Ratanchand Hirachand v Askar Nawaz Jung —

(dead) by L.Rs., (1991) 3 SCC 67 has observed:

 

“The legislature often fails to keep pace with the changing needs
and values, nor it is realistic to expect that it will have provided all
contingencies and eventualities. It is, therefore, not only necessary

but obligatory on the court to step in to fill the lacuna.” (para 17)

The above principle is equally attracted if we propose to legislate
rules of interpretation regarding use of external aids. The legislature
cannot, when it makes a law today, foresee the kind of aids which may
be useful after a gap of years nor can it foresee all situations in which a
particular aid can be helpful. For example, now courts use information

of judgements of foreign jurisdictions which is available on internet, as
