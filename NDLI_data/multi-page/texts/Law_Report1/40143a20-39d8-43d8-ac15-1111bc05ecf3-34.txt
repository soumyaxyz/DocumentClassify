Interpretation Act‚Äù does not contain provisions regarding use of external

material.

In Australia, a new section 15AB has been inserted in the
Interpretation Act, 1901 regarding use of extrinsic material in the
interpretation of an Act. Sub-section (1) provides that in the
interpretation of a provision of an Act, any material which is not forming
part of the Act (extrinsic material) is capable of assisting in the
ascertainment of the meaning of the provision in certain circumstances.
Sub-section (2) provides a list of material that may be considered for the

interpretation. But this list is also inclusive in form.

Further, some of the rules of interpretation on the use of extrinsic
aids even though they have undergone some changes, do not require any
codification in this regard and the recommendations made in the 60

Report have not lost relevance.

On the basis of the discussion above, we are of the view; (1) in the
event of ambiguity of a provision, for the purpose of interpretation of
such a statutory provision, courts can certainly take recourse to material
or aids outside the statute, i.e., external aids, and (2) the rules of
interpretation specially regarding use of external aids, should not be

incorporated in the General Clauses Act, 1897 at all.

We recommend accordingly.

Regarding the issue (B):

Whether recommendations made in the 60th Report of the

Commission need any revision or whether they have lost relevance now.
