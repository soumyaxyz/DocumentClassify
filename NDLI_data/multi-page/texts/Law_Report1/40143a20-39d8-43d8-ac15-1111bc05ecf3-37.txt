In this connection section 29 of the Act of 1897 is relevant, which

is quoted below:

“29. Savings for previous enactments, rules and bylaws.

 

The provisions of this Act respecting the construction of
Acts, Regulations, rules or bye laws made after the
commencement of this Act, shall not affect the construction
of any Act, Regulation, rule or bye law made before the
commencement of this Act, although the Act, Regulation,
rule or bye-law is continued or amended by an_ Act,
Regulation, rule or bye law made after the commencement of

this Act.”

This section 29 forbids the application of its provisions for the
purpose of construction of such Acts, Regulations, rules or bye laws
which had been made before the commencement of the General Clauses
Act, 1897, even though they have continued in operation after the
commencement of Act of 1897 or amended by a subsequent legislation

after 1897.

This section 29 corresponds to section 40 of British Interpretation

Act, 1889. It states as follows:

“40. Saving for past Acts.
The provisions of this Act respecting the construction of Acts

passed after the commencement of this Act shall not affect the
construction of any Act passed before the commencement of this
Act, although it is continued or amended by an Act passed after

such commencement.”
