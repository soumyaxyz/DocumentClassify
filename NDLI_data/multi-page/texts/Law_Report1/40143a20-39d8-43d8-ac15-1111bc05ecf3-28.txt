Pollution Control Board II vs Prof. M.V. Nayudu, (2001) 2 SCC 62); right
to health care (State of Punjab vs Ram Lubhaya, (1998)4 SCC 11). Now,
‘procedure established by law’ means that substantive law as well as
procedural law must be fust, fair and reasonable’. Meaning of words
‘affairs of state’ appearing in section 123 of the Evidence Act has also
undergone drastic changes with the passage of time. In this regard, Law

Commission in its 60‘ Report at para 2.9 has observed:
“Moreover, with the passage of time, there may be changes in the
meaning of words. As has been stated, ‘some words are confined

to their history, while some are starting points for history.”

In Santa Singh v State of Punjab, AIR 1976 SC 2386, Supreme

 

Court observed:

“It was Mr. Justice Holmes who pointed out in his inimitable style
that, ‘a word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged’, it is the
skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in colour and content
according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.”

(para 4)

This kind of rule that the meaning of the words may get changed

with the passage of time cannot be expressed in legislative form.

While interpreting a provision, it is not proper for the court to take
a mechanical or mathematical meaning of a word. The Law Commission

in its 60th Report has observed, in this regard:

“2.12 It is of course, well recognized that interpretation is not
merely a process of spelling out the meaning by set guidelines.

Sometimes, it has to partake of the character of law making.
