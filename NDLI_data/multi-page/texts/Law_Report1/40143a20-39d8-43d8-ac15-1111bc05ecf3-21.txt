Similarly, Supreme Court used information available on internet
for the purpose of interpretation of statutory provision in Ramlal v State
of Rajasthan, (2001) 1 SCC 175. Courts also refer passages and
materials from text books and articles and papers published in the
journals. We are of the view that these external aids are very useful tools
not only for the proper and correct interpretation or construction of
statutory provision, but also for understanding the object of the statute,
the mischief sought to be remedied by it, circumstances in which it was
enacted and many other relevant matters. In the absence of the
admissibility of these external aids, sometime court may not be in a

position to do justice in a case.

Application of external aids cannot be uniform

 

As discussed above, the external aids are very useful tools for the
interpretation or construction of statutory provisions. Law is almost
settled in our country on the issue as to which external aids are
admissible and what weight age should be given to each such aid. There
is no uncertainty about the admissibility of these aids. Courts are
following uniform process in this respect. But it does not necessarily
mean that in every case, court should take recourse to each admissible
external aid. Each case contains different facts and circumstances.
Court has to apply the appropriate law to the facts and circumstances of
the case. So, when the court refuses to take recourse to a particular
external aid in a specific case rather than to another external aid
because of the special facts, circumstances and context of the case, it
does not mean that courts are not following uniform process or the law is

uncertain.

Whether external aids can be incorporated into the General Clauses Act
