is real in SO(,J), i.e., there exists T € SO(J) such that TAT~! = A~!. Then T maps

the A-cigen subspace of A to the \~!-eigen subspace of A and vice-versa. Hence T

for m x m matrices B and C. Since T is orthogonal, it satisfies TJT = J, which
gives BSC = S. That is, det(B) det(C) = 1. Hence det(T) = (—1)™ det(B) det(C) =
— det(B) det(C) = —1 since m is odd. This contradicts that T € SO(J). Hence A is
not real in SO(J) and hence t is not real in SO(Q).

Lemma 7.4.5. Let dim(V) =0 (mod 4) andt € SO(Q) be semisimple. Suppose
t has only two distinct eigenvalues \ and \~\(hence \ # £1) over k. Then, any
element g € O(Q) such that gtg-! = t~ belongs to SO(Q), i.e., det(g) = 1.

 

Proof. We follow the notation in the previous lemma. Let dim(V) = 2m, where

m is even. As in the proof of the previous lemma, we may assume t is diagonal. Then

any element T that conjugates t to t7' over k, is of the form T = Cor We

have det(T) = (—1)™ det(B) det(C) = det(B) det(C) = 1. Since g is a conjugate of

T, the claim follows.

 

 

 

 

Now we state the main theorem about special orthogonal groups.

Theorem 7.4.6. Let t © SO(Q) be a semisimple element. Then, t is real in
SO(Q) if and only if t is strongly real in SO(Q).

Proof. If dim(V) #2 (mod 4) then the theorem follows from Propositions 7.4.2
and 7.4.3. Hence let us assume that dim(V) = 2 (mod 4). Let dim(V) = 2m where
m is odd. In this case we will prove that the element t is real in SO(Q) if and only
if 1 or —1 is an eigenvalue of t.

First we prove that if 1 and —1 are not eigenvalues then t is not real. It is enough

to prove this statement over k. We write V = V @, k and continue to denote t over
