34 5. MAXIMAL TORI IN SU,

 

 

 

Hence the last assertion.

 

Remark 5.1.2. We note that € = F @, L. If we put F’ = {x € E | o(x) = —x}
then € =F @F". Farther, if L = k(y) with 7? € k*, then F’ = Fy.

Notation : In what follows, we shall often deal with situations when, for an
algebraic group G defined over k, and for any extension K of k, the group G(K) of
K-rational points in G coincides with G(k) ®, &. When no confusion is likely to
arise, we shall abuse notation and use G' to denote both the algebraic group, as well
as its group of k-points. We shall identify Te,,) with its image in U(E, h™), under

the embedding via left homotheties.

Lemma 5.1.3. With notation as in the previous lemma, Ti¢,5) is a maximal k-
torus in U(E,h“), the unitary group of the hermitian space (€,6™).

Corollary 5.1.4. Let Teo) = {a € &* | ao(a) = 1, det(a) = 1}. Then Teo) Cc
SU(E,4™) is a maximal k-torus.

Theorem 5.1.5. Letk be a field and L a quadratic field extension of k. We denote
by o the nontrivial k-automorphism of L. Let V be a L-vector space of dimension n
with a nondegenerate o-hermitian form h. Let T Cc U(V,6) be a maximal k-torus.
Then there exists Ep, an étale L-algebra of dimension n over L, with an involution
dy restricting to the nontrivial k-automorphism of L, such that

T = Teer):

Moreover, if Er is a field, there exists u € F* such that (V,h) ts isomorphic to

(Er,6™) as a hermitian space.

Proof. Let A = End,(V). Then A is a central simple L-algebra. Let Er = Z4(T),
the centralizer of T in A. Note that TC Er. The hermitian form h defines the adjoint

involution oy on A (see Section 1.3),
oy: A — A

b(a(A(x),y) = bi, Fly)
for all x,y € V. Then oy is an involution of second kind over L/k on A (Defini-
tion 1.3.2). We claim that oy restricts to Ep: Let f € Er, we need to show o4(f) € Er,
Le., on(f)t = toy(f) Vt € T. This follows from,

H(on(ft(x).y) = b(t(x), fy) = bet F(y)) = bla, fey)
= b(o9(f)(x), ty) = 6(ton(f)(2), 9).
