defined using Aut(G,,) = Z. For each a € © there exists a unique (up to scalars)
homomorphism tu: Ga + G such that tua(x)t7! = uo(a(t)x) for all z € G, and t €
T. The image of uq is denoted as Uy, called the root subgroup of G corresponding
to a ([Sp], Proposition 8.1.1). The root subgroups are minimal proper subgroups
of U and U~. Moreover, the ua can be chosen such that there is a homomorphism

We have associated a root datum (X(T), ®,Y(T),®”) to a reductive group G

with respect to a fixed maximal torus T in G. One can prove that this data does

We define aY: Gy, — T by aY (x) = da , |. Then aY €Y and is called the

not depend on the choice of a maximal torus. Every reductive group is classified by
its root datum ([Sp], Theorem 10.1.1). One can give an abstract definition of root
datum and we have a reductive group corresponding to each root datum. We briefly
describe how the Weyl group W can be defined from root datum. We let &* be
the set of roots arising from root subgroups of U and ®~ be those coming from U~.
Roots in 6+, ®~ are called positive and negative roots respectively. Let A be the
set of positive roots which can not be written as sum of two positive roots. Roots
in A are called simple roots. The group W(A) generated by simple reflections, i.e.,
reflections with respect to simple roots, is the Weyl group ([SV], Theorem 8.3.4).
There is an element wo € W such that wo(@*) = ®~. This element wo is unique and
is of order 2 called the longest element.

Let G be a semisimple algebraic group. Let Q C X be its root lattice. Then the
fundamental group X/Q is a finite group. Let P be the dual lattice of Q. One can
identify P with the weight lattice and we have Q@ c X C P. A semisimple group G
is called simply connected if X = P and adjoint if X = Q.
