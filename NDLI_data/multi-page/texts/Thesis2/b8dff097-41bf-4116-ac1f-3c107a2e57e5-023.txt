CHAPTER 2
Linear Algebraic Groups

In this chapter we give a brief account of the theory of algebraic groups. For the
material covered here, we refer the books [S3], [Sp], [Hu] and [Bo], written by some

of the masters of the subject.

2.1. Definition and Examples

Let k be an algebraically closed field. An algebraic group G is a variety over k
with a group structure on it such that the maps m: Gx G — G defined by (x,y) > xy
and i: G — G defined by 2 ++ 21 are maps of varieties. If the underlying variety
of G is an affine variety over k then the group is called an affine algebraic group.
We give some examples below.

Examples :

(1) The multiplicative group G,, and the additive group G, of k are algebraic
groups.

(2) The general linear group GL, is an algebraic group. Following subgroups
of GL, are examples of algebraic group: a finite subgroup, D, (diagonal matrices in
GL,), Tn (upper triangular matrices in GL,,), Un (unipotent upper triangular matrices
in GL,), SL, (special linear group i.e. matrices of determinant 1), O, (orthogonal
group), SO, (special orthogonal group), Span (symplectic group).

(3) Elliptic curves are example of algebraic groups which are not affine.

Any affine algebraic group G is a closed subgroup of some GL,,. Hence often affine
algebraic groups are called linear algebraic groups. In this thesis we will only deal
with linear algebraic groups and hence we will drop the adjective affine (or linear)
occasionally.

Let k be a field and k be an algebraic closure of k. An algebraic group G is defined
over k: (or G is a k-group) if the polynomials defining the underlying variety G are
defined over k, with the group maps m and i defined over k and the identity element
e € Gisa k-rational point. We denote the k-points of G by G(k).
