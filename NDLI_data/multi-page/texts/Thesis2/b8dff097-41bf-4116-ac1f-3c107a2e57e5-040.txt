Example 1: Let K be a finite Galois extension of a field k. Let G = Gal(K/k)
be the Galois group. Then G acts on the additive group K by evaluation. Then
H°(G,K) =k and H‘(G, K) = 0 for all i > 1.

Example 2: Let K be a Galois extension of a field k. Let G denote the Galois
group Gal(K/k). Then G acts on the Abelian group K* by evaluation. Then the
cohomology groups are :

(1) H°(G, K*) =k*.
(2) H1(G, K*) =1 (Hilbert’s theorem 90).
(3) H?(G, K*) = Br(K/k).

The group Br(K’/k) is the relative Brauer group which we introduce below.

 

(3) H?(G, A) =

4.1.1. Central Simple Algebras and the Brauer Group. Let k be a field.
Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over k. Then A is called simple if it has no
two sided ideals other than 0 and A. A finite dimensional algebra is called a central
simple algebra if it is simple and Z(A) = k. From Wedderburn’s structure theorem
({P], Theorem, Section 3.5) it follows that a central simple algebra A is isomorphic
to M,(D) where D is a central division algebra over k. Equivalently, a central simple
algebra of degree n over k is a k-algebra A such that A@,k ~ M,,(k) as k-algebras. We
define an equivalence relation on the set of finite dimensional central simple algebras
over field k as follows. We call A and B equivalent if one of the following equivalent
conditions is satisfied:

(i) If AS M,(D) and B = M,,(D’) then D & D’.

(ii) There exist m,n such that A ®@ M,,(k) = B@ M,(k).
The Brauer group of k ({P], Proposition a, Section 12.5) is the set of equivalence
classes of finite dimensional central simple algebras over k with multiplication defined
by tensor product. It is denoted as Br(k). Brauer group of a field is an Abelian group.
We give few examples here.

(1) Br(F) = {0}, for any finite field F.

(2) Br(k) = {0}, for any algebraically closed field k. In fact, Br(k) = {0}, for

any field & of transcendence degree one over an algebraically closed field.
(3) Br(R) = Z/2Z.
