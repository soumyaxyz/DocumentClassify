10.2. PROGRAMME AND FURTHER QUESTIONS 97

G in hand, we calculated conjugacy classes of centralizers in groups of type G2 (see
Section 8.5). It would be of interest to calculate the conjugacy classes of centralizers
in classical groups and parameterize them using Galois cohomology.

We thank you for showing interest in this thesis.
