and we have proved that t is a product of two involutions on each component. Hence

 

 

 

t is strongly real.

 

Corollary 7.6.3. Lett € SU(V,h) be semisimple. Supposen #2 (mod 4). Then
t is real in SU(V,6) if and only if it is strongly real.

Proof. The result follows by keeping track of the determinant of the conjugating

 

 

element in the proof of Theorem 7.6.2.

 

Remarks 7.6.4. 1. Let K be a quadratic extension of k. Let V be a two

dimensional vector space over a field K with a nondegenerate hermitian form b defined

 

as follows. Let {e1,¢2} be a basis of V such that (e1,e1) = 1,6(e2,e2) = —1 an

h(e1,¢€2) = 0. In the matrix notation, the matrix of the form is H = =

and U(H) = {X € GL2(K) | 'XHX = H}. Let A= (; :) € SU(H) where

SU(H). For T to be in SU(H) we need bc = —1 and this implies T? = —1. Hence no
involution conjugates A to its inverse. But if K has an element b such that bb = —1,
then A can be conjugated to A7! by T such that T? = —1. For example one can take
K =Q(vY5) andk=Q.

2. Let V be a two dimensional vector space over K with a hermitian form h on
it. Let K = k(y). Let {e1,e2} be a basis of V such that h(e1,e1) = 0, h(e2, e2) = 0

and h(e1,e2) = y = —b(e2,e1). In the matrix notation, the matrix of the form is
H= | ‘) and U(H) = {X € GL2(K) | '‘XHX = H}. Let A= ; : E
SU(H). Then Aisa unipotent element. Let T € GL(K) be such that TAT! = AT}.
Then T is of the form T’ = ( 5 [ ) Note that A is real in U(#) if and only
if there exists T = 5 7 with a@ = —1 and ab — ab = 0. Here T? = a?I.

The element A is not strongly real in SU(H). For if so, we would have a? = 1 and

aa = —1, which would imply that 7 is a square in k. Hence no involution conjugates
