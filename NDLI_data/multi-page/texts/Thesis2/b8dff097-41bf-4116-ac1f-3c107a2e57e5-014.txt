2 0. PROLOGUE

Chapters 1 to 5 are preliminary in nature and are intended to introduce most of
the basic concepts used in this thesis. We do not aim to give a complete account
of these topics but try to give most of the definitions and results used later and
provide appropriate references for these results. In Chapter 1 we describe the classical
groups with which we deal in this thesis. There are excellent references ([A], [G] to
mention a few) available on this topic and the subject is usually referred in literature
as “Geometric Algebra”. The modern theory, from the point of view of algebraic
groups, is treated very well in [KMRT].

In Chapter 2 we give a brief account of the theory of algebraic groups. In this chap-
ter, we introduce some definitions and terminologies which we keep using throughout
this thesis. For a detailed study of the theory of algebraic groups, we refer the reader
to [S3], [Sp], [Hu], [Bo].

In this thesis we also deal with exceptional groups of type Gj. In Chapter 3 we
describe how to obtain all groups of type G2 over k. The book [SV] is an excellent
reference for the subject. We develop the theory to suit our needs and describe results
from some of the papers, specifically from [J] and [W2], which we use while proving
our results.

Galois cohomology is introduced in Chapter 4. We describe how Galois cohomol-
ogy describes forms of certain algebraic groups. The book [Se] is a good source for
this topic.

In Chapter 5 we give a description of maximal tori in SU,,. Though a description
of maximal tori in classical groups is available in [Ka] and [R], for our work we need
details of this description for SU,. We also describe how decomposability of tori is
related to representations.

Chapter 6 collects together all main results. Here we describe all the results
obtained in this thesis and known results in that direction. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are
devoted to the proofs of the results.

For number theoretic preliminaries (e.g. local and global field, ramification theory,
division algebra etc.), we refer the reader to the excellent text [CF].

The problem which we have dealt with is closely related to representation theory.
In Chapter 10 we describe this connection and try to put forward our question in
general theory of representations of algebraic groups. We also take this opportunity
to describe some of the questions that remain to be answered. We hope the results

in this thesis will contribute to the understanding of the subject.
