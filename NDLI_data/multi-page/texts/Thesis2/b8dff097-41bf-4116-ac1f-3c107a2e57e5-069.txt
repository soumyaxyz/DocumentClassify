7.6. UNITARY GROUPS 57

Now let us assume that t is conjugate to —t~!. We follow the same proof as above
except that we consider Wa = Va © Vx-1 ® V_a ® V_g-1 when a? # +1. We construct

9rq using Lemma 7.5.2 in this case. The rest of the proof is along similar lines as

 

 

 

 

above.

 

Remark 7.5.4. We give an example to show that there are semisimple real ele-

ments in S'p(4,k) which are not a product of two involutions. Let

mn(( 08)

be the matrix of the skew-symmetric (symplectic) form. Then Sp(4,k) = {A €
GL(4,k) | AJA = J}. Let S$ = diag(A, A+, wu, w-!) € Sp(4,k) with all diagonal
entries distinct. Then any element T' € Sp(4,k), such that TST-! = S™!, is of the

following type:
0 —-a 0 —b
T = dia ;

such that T? = —1. Hence A is real semisimple but not a product of two involutions.

7.6. Unitary Groups

In this section we deal with unitary groups. Let AK be a quadratic field extension
of k. Let V be an n-dimensional vector space with a nondegenerate hermitian form
6. Then

U(V,b) = {t € GL(V) | b(t(v), t(w)) = b(v, w) Vu, w € V}

is a k-group. Let k be an algebraic closure of k. We denote V = V @,; k, a module
over K @, k. We define h on V by base change of h to k. Then U(V,6) is an
algebraic group defined over k and U(V,6) is the group of k-points of U(V,4). Let
{e1,...,€n} be an orthogonal basis of V with respect to h. Let (e;,e;) = a; € k and
let H = diag(ay,...,a,). Then U(V,h) = U(H) ={A€ GL, (K) | AHA = FH}.

Lemma 7.6.1. Let V be a two dimensional vector space over K with a nonde-
generate hermitian form h. Let e1,e2 be an orthogonal basis of V with b(e:,e:) = hi
hy 0
and H = 0 he | Let A be any diagonal matrix in U(H). Then A is real in
12
U(H) if and only if hyhy € Nije(K*) and, in that case, it is strongly real.
