86 8. REALITY IN GROUPS OF TYPE G2
Hence we have proved,

Theorem 8.5.9. Let G be the anisotropic group of type Gg over R. Then the

total number of orbit types (conjugacy classes of centralizers) are five, corresponding
to elements

I, diag{a, 3, y}, diag{a, 3, 3}, diag{1, —1, —1}, diag{1, a, a}

where none of a,3,y are 1 or -1.
