had all kind of discussions from life to academics and from politics to philosophy.
With many friends at HRI, Punita, Thanga, Kalyan, Sanoli, Purusottam, Siddhartha,
Aarti, Anupama, Sahu, Vikram, Supriya, Tanusree, Archana, Nishikant, Bindusar,
Manoj, Anamitra, Rajeev, Kalpataru, Arijit, I had a nice time. All badminton,
football and cricket players in HRI (and in ISI) deserve special thanks because sports
is the next best thing I love. As it goes with a great saying that ‘A healthy mind lives
in a healthy body’ all of the players have played a great part in shaping my life and
making me a better person. I have fond memories of my little friends (most of the
kids in HRI), specially Rishabh and Rupam, having played with them. I hope they
will not forget me. Many friends at ISI, Bangalore, specially Dishant, Suhas, Tejas
and Binod deserve my thanks for being helpful and making my life comfortable.

Finally this endeavor would not have existed without support from my parents

 

and my brother. There can not be any substitute for the unconditional support and
love of my parents, who have given me complete freedom over the years. My brother,
Anish, who is a good friend and with whom I have shared/discussed every event of
my life, needs to be mentioned here for always being there.

I dedicate this thesis to my school teachers.

The comments of referees has been very useful to improve this thesis.
