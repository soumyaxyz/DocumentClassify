20 3. GROUPS OF TYPE G2

1 >), where < 1 > denotes the bilinear form (x,y) H zy on k. Fixing a trivialization
w: AX(V,6) & (k, < 1 >), we define a vector product x: Vx V — V by the identity,
b(u,uxw) = ~(uAvAvw), for u,v,w € V. Let Q be the 4-dimensional k-vector space
Q = Q(k; V,6,w) =k @V. We define a multiplication on Q by,

(a, v)(b, w) = (ab — b(v,w), aw+bu+uxw), abek, vpwev.

With this multiplication, Q is a quaternion algebra over k, with norm N(a,v) =
a? + b(v,v). The isomorphism class of Q thus obtained, does not depend on w. One

can show that all quaternion algebras arise this way.

Proposition 3.1.6. Let (V,6) and (V',6’) be isometric quadratic spaces with
trivial discriminants, over a field k. Then the quaternion algebras Q(k;V,6) and
Q(k; V', 6’) are isomorphic.

3.2. Some Subgroups of G2

Let € be an octonion algebra over a field k (of characteristic 4 2). Let L be a
composition subalgebra of €. In this section, we describe subgroups of G = Aut(€),

consisting of automorphisms leaving L pointwise fixed or invariant. We define
G(€/L) = {t € Aut(€) | t((z) =a V ae L}
and
G(€, L) = {t € Aut(€) | tw) e LVaxe L}.
Jacobson studied G(€/L) in his paper ({J]). We mention the descriptions of these
subgroups here. One knows that the two dimensional composition algebras over k
are precisely the quadratic étale algebras over k ([KMRT], Theorem 33.17). Let L
be a two dimensional composition subalgebra of €. Then L is either a quadratic field
extension of k or L &k x k. Let us assume first that LD is a quadratic field extension

of k and L = k(y), where 7? = c.1 40. Then L+ is a left L vector space via the

octonion multiplication. Also,
h: Lt x I+ L
h(2,y) = N(a,y) +y"N(y2,y),
is a nondegenerate hermitian form on L+ over L. Any automorphism ¢ of €, fixing

L pointwise, induces an L-linear map t|,1: L+ —+ L+. Then we have ([J], Theorem
3),
