3.2. SOME SUBGROUPS OF G2 23

Then p? = 1 and p|, = and p is an automorphism of €. One can prove that this
construction yields the one given above for the split octonion algebra and its diagonal

subalgebra. We have,

Proposition 3.2.5. Let € be an octonion algebra, possibly division, and L Cc €
a quadratic composition subalgebra. Then G(€,L) = G(€/L) x H, where H is the
subgroup generated by p and p is an automorphism of € with p? =1 and p restricted

to L is the nontrivial k-automorphism of L.

We mention a few more subgroups of Aut(€). Let D Cc € be a quaternion
subalgebra. Then we have, by Cayley-Dickson doubling, € = 9 © Da for some
a € + with N(a) 4 0. Let ¢ € Aut(€) be such that (x) = x for all x € 9.
Then for z = x+ ya € €, we have, 6(z) = (x) + o(y)d(a). But a € D+ implies
o(a) € D+ = Da. Therefore d(a) = pa for some p € D and, by taking norms, we see
that p € SL\(®). In fact, we have ([SV], Proposition 2.2.1),

Proposition 3.2.6. The group of automorphisms of €, leaving D pointwise fixed,
is isomorphic to SLi(®), the group of elements of D whose norm is 1. In the above
notation, G(€/D) = SL(D).

We describe yet another subgroup of Aut(€). Let D be as above and ¢ € Aut(®).
We can write € = D © Da as above. Define 6 € Aut(€) by (a + ya) = o(x) +
¢(y)a. Then one checks easily that é is an automorphism of € that extends ¢@ on 9D.
These automorphisms form a subgroup of Aut(€), which we shall abuse notation and
continue to denote by Aut(®).

Proposition 3.2.7. With notation as fixed, we have G(€,D) = G(€/D) xAut(D).

Proof. Clearly Aut(®) M G(€/D) = {1} and Aut(D) normalizes G(€/D). Now,
for w € G(€,D), consider the automorphism ¢ = wot. Then ¢ fixes elements of H
pointwise and we have ) = $y) € G(€/D) x Aut(D).

 

 

 

Some of these subgroups are conjugate in the group G. We have a Skolem-Noether

 

type theorem for composition algebras ([SV], Corollary 1.7.3) which can be used to

describe conjugacy of some of these subgroups.

Theorem 3.2.8. Let € be a composition algebra and let D and D' be composition
subalgebras of the same dimension. Then, every linear isomorphism from D onto D'

can be extended to an automorphism of €.
