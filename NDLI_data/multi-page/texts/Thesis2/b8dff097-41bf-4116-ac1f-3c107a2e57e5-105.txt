CHAPTER 10
Epilogue

In this chapter, we address the question of reality in the frame work of represen-
tation theory. We start with a discussion of the question for finite groups. We do
not define some of the terminology used in this chapter, however we give appropriate

references.

10.1. Reality Question and Representation Theory

First we discuss real representations of a finite group and its relation to real
elements in the group. For the theory here we refer to the book [JL] chapter 23. Let
G be a finite group. We consider representations of G over C. A character y of G is
called real if y(g) € R, for all g € G. Then we have (see [JL], Theorem 23.1),

Proposition 10.1.1. Let G be a finite group. The number of real irreducible

characters of G is equal to the number of real conjugacy classes of G.

Note that if an element g is real then all conjugates of g are real and we call the
conjugacy class of g, a real conjugacy class. A representation ¢: G — GL(V) is
realizable if it is defined over R, i.e. with respect to some basis of V the ¢(G) C
GL,(R). It is obvious that a character corresponding to a realizable representation
is real. This brings us to the question of determining representations which give rise

to real characters.

Proposition 10.1.2. Let G be a finite group and x be an irreducible character
of a representation V. Then, x is real if and only if there is a non-zero G-invariant

bilinear form on the representation space V.

A representation (¢,V) of G is called orthogonal (symplectic) if there exists a
non-zero symmetric (skew-symmetric) bilinear form on V which is G-invariant. That
is, o(G) C O,(C) if the representation is orthogonal and ¢(G) C Spom(C) if the
representation is symplectic. The next proposition determines which real characters
come from realizable representations.
