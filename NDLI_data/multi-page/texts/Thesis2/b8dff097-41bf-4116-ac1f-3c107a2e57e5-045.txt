CHAPTER 5
Maximal Tori in SU,,

We need an explicit description of maximal tori in the special unitary group of
a nondegenerate hermitian space for our work, we discuss it in this chapter (cf. [R],
Section 3.4). In fact maximal tori in any classical group can be described in this way.
The general theory is known to experts hence we restrict ourself to the specific case.

We refer to [Ka] for the description of maximal tori in classical groups, in general.

5.1. Description of Maximal Tori

Let & be a field (of characteristic different from 2) and L a quadratic field exten-
sion of k. Let V be a vector space of dimension n over L. We denote by k, a separable
closure of k containing L. Let h be a nondegenerate hermitian form on V (see Defi-
nition 1.1.2). Let € be an étale algebra (see Definition 3.1.3) over k. It then follows
that the bilinear form T: € x € — k, induced by the trace : T(«,y) = tres, (xy) for

x,y € E, is nondegenerate.

Lemma 5.1.1. Let L be a quadratic field extension of k. Let E be an étale algebra
over k containing L, equipped with an involution o, restricting to the non-trivial k-
automorphism of L. Let F = €° = {x € E | o(x) = x}. Let dim, (€) = n. For
u€ F*, define

Hh : ExE—L
bh (a,y) = tres, (uxo(y)).

Then h“ is a nondegenerate o-hermitian form on E, left invariant by Teo) = {a€

E* | ao(a) = 1}, under the action by left multiplication.

Proof. That “ is a hermitian form is clear. To check non-degeneracy, let
bh (x,y) = 0 Vy € €. Then, tre, (uxo(y)) = 0 Vy € €, ie., tresz(xy’) = 0 Vy! € €.
Since € is étale, it follows that x = 0. Therefore h“) is nondegenerate. Now let
a € Tie,¢). We have,

bh“ (ax, ay) = tre/r(uaro(ay)) = tresr(uro(y)) = 6 (a, y).
