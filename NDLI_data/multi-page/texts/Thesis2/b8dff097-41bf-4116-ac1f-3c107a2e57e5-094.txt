and t' = Ki, where p € SL,(Q) and p' € SL1(Q') and both p,p' ¢ k. Suppose L = k(p)
and L' = k(p') are isomorphic field extensions of k. Then Zq(t) is conjugate to Z(t’)
inG.

Proof. As Q and Q’ are isomorphic, by Theorem 3.2.8 we have an automorphism
¢ of € such that ¢|qg is the given isomorphism of Q to Q’. By conjugating the element
t' by @ we may assume ¢ and t’ both belong to G(€/Q). Let L and L’ be isomorphic.
Then there exists an isomorphism ~ = 3,, conjugation by c € Q, which gives the
isomorphism of L to L’. Let g € Z¢(R,). From previous lemma g = ®,,I-, with
pic, € L. Then,

We note that epyc-teeyc~? = cpyeyc! € L’. This implies gw! € Z(t’) and hence

Zc(t) is conjugate to Z(t’) in G.

 

 

 

 

Remark 8.5.4. In similar way one can calculate centralizers of elements of
G(€,Q). Let t € G(€,Q). Let t = R,3. where p € SL,(Q) and c € Q—k. Then
Za(t) = {Mp Je, | cr € k(c), pica € k(pe)}.

We note that the center of SL,(Q) is {1,—1} and the element ¢ in Aut(€) cor-
responding to —1 is a non-trivial involution (ie. t? = 1). By a similar calculation
as above it is easy to see that Z(t) = G(€,Q) for 1 # t an involution. In fact any
non-trivial involution in Aut(€) correspond to a quaternion subalgebra in this fash-
ion. Two involutions are conjugate if and only if the corresponding fixed quaternion
subalgebras are isomorphic (see Section 3.3). From Proposition 3.2.9, two involutions
have their centralizers conjugate if and only if the corresponding fixed quaternion
subalgebras are isomorphic. We observe that the centralizers corresponding to invo-
lutions and other type of elements in Lemma 8.5.3 are not isomorphic hence they can
not be conjugate in the group G.

Let t € G = Aut(€) where € is a division octonion algebra. Then ¢ fixes a
quadratic subfield L pointwise as the dimension of €' is > 2. Moreover we can
find a,b € € such that Q = L @ La is a quaternion subalgebra and € = Q © Qb.
Then L+ is a hermitian space over L. With respect to the basis {a,b,ab} we write
the subgroup SU(L+,) of G as SU(H) = {A € SL(3,L) | AHA = H} where
H = diag{h(a, a), h(b, b), h(ab, ab)}. We denote the matrix of t as A with respect to
this basis. We observe that t leaves a quaternion subalgebra fixed pointwise if and
only if 1 is an eigenvalue of A, i.e., X — 1 is a factor of the characteristic polynomial

xa(X). The conjugacy classes of centralizers of such elements have been already
