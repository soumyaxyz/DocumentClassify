CHAPTER 4
Galois Cohomology

In this chapter we give a brief introduction to Galois Cohomology. The book by
Serre ({Se]) is an excellent reference for the subject and the exposition here is drawn
from that book. Another good reference is the notes by Kneser ([K]). Occasionally
we also need the theory of central simple algebras for which we refer to [P]. To
understand the theory of algebraic groups over base field k it is very important to

understand Galois Cohomology.

4.1. Commutative Cohomology and Central Simple Algebra

Let G be a group and let A be a set on which G acts. We denote the action by
s(a) =*a for s € Gandaé A. We call Aa G-set. If A is a group and the action of G

is via automorphisms then we call A a G-group. Let A be an Abelian G-group. We
define C°(G, A) = A and C'(G, A) = {a: Gx... x G — A} which is the set of all
SS

maps from G x ... x G to A. We also write a(si,...,$;) aS Gs,,...5;. We define maps

is a chain-complex. We define 2'(G,A) = ker(6'), the group of cocycles and
B'(G, A) = Im(6"1), the group of coboundaries. Then B'(G, A) C 2*(G, A) and
2(G,A)

we define H'(G,A) = BUGA)? called i-th cohomology group. The cohomology

groups are Abelian groups. We write down first few cohomology groups explicitly.
(1) H°(G, A) = AT = {aE A| 8a =aVs € G}, the set of fixed points of A by
the action of G.
