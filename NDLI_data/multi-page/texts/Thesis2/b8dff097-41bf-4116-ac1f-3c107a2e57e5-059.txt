CHAPTER 7
Reality in Classical Groups

In this chapter we discuss structure of real elements in classical groups. These
groups have been described in Chapter 1. We prove the results mentioned in Sec-

tion 6.1. The results in this section are part of [ST2].

7.1. The Groups GL, (k) and SL,,(k)

We begin by recording a theorem of Wonenburger ([W1], Theorem 1) for GLn,

which, in fact, is the motivating example for our results.

Proposition 7.1.1. An element of GL,(k) is real if and only if it is strongly real
in GL,(k).

In this section we explore the structure of real elements in SL,(k). We follow the

proof of Wonenburger for GL,,(k) ([W1], Theorem 1) and modify it for our purpose.

Theorem 7.1.2. Let V be a vector space of dimension n over k. Lett € SL(V).
Suppose n #2 (mod 4). Then t is real in SL(V) if and only if t is strongly real in
SL(V).

Proof. Let 6,(X),...,6,(X) be the invariant factors of t in kLX]. Since t is real,
each 6;(X) is self-reciprocal. The space V decomposes as V = @'_,V;, where each V; is
a cyclic, t invariant subspace of V and the minimal polynomial of t; = tly, is the self-
reciprocal polynomial 6;(X). We shall construct involutions H; in GL(V;), conjugating
t; to t;', with det(H;) = (—1)™ if dimension of V; = 2m and det(H;) = (—1)™ or
(—1)™+! when dimension of V; = 2m +1. We then take H = 6',H;. Then H is an
involution conjugating ¢ to t~! and det(H) = 1 if dim(V) 4 2 (mod 4).

Now t; is a cyclic linear transformation on the vector space V; with characteristic
polynomial y;,(X) = 6;(X) self-reciprocal. We can write \;,(X) = (X — 1)"(X +
1)*f(X) where f(+1) 40 and V; = W_1 @W, @ Wo, where W_1, W, and Wo are the
kernels of (¢; — 1)", (t; + 1)* and f(t;) respectively. To produce the involution H; on

 

V; as above, it suffices to do so on each of W_1,W, and Wo. Hence it is enough to
