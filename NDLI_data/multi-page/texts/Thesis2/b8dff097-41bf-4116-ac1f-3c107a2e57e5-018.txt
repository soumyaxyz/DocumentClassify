6 1. CLASSICAL GROUPS

unitary group are denoted as O,,(6) (or On(q)), Spon(6) and U,,(b) respectively. We

have,

O,(b) = {A€GL,(k) | ABA = B}
Spon(b6) = {A € GLo,(k) | ABA = BY
U,(b) = {A€GL,(k) | ABA = B}.

where A is the matrix having entries @;; where aj; is the ij” entry of A.

Let us first analyze the structure of orthogonal and unitary groups. Let V be
a vector space over k with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form or a hermitian

form B on it. Then we have,

Proposition 1.2.1. Let (V,6) be as above. Then there exists a basis {e1,..., én}
of V such that 6(e;,e;) =0 for alli F j.

We call such a basis an orthogonal basis for V. Then the matrix of the form
is diag(Ai,...,An) where A; = b(e,e;) € k* if 6 is symmetric and \; € kj if 6 is
hermitian. Over an algebraically closed field, one can choose an orthonormal basis in
the first case and the orthogonal group is O,(6) = {A € GL, (k) | AA = J}.

A transformation 7 € O(V, q) is called a reflection if there exist an element v € V
with q(v) 4 0 such that r(v) = —v and 7 fixes every vector orthogonal to v. We also
denote 7 by T,. In fact, we have
6(x, v)

q(v)

Theorem 1.2.2 (Cartan, Dieudonne). Let V be a vector space of dimension n

 

T(x) =x-2 v.

over a field k. Let q be a nondegenerate quadratic form on it. Then every element in

O(V,q) is a product of at most n reflections.

The group SO(V, q) is of index 2 in O(V,q). An element in O(V, q) is called a proper

isometry if it belongs to SO(V,q) otherwise it is improper.

Corollary 1.2.3. With hypothesis as above, if n is odd and tT € O(V,q) is a

proper isometry then T has a non zero fixed point in V.

Study of involutions in the orthogonal group is of great importance. An involution in

this group corresponds to a nondegenerate subspace of V (see [G], Proposition 6.11).

Proposition 1.2.4. With notation as above, let rT € O(V,q) be an involution, i.e.,

7? =1. Then there exists a nondegenerate subspace U of V such that tT = —1|\y @lyn-
