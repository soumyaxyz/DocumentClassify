CHAPTER 8
Reality in Groups of Type G2

This whole chapter is devoted to the study of reality properties in groups of type
G2. We give proofs to results mentioned in the Section 6.2. We also obtain results
on conjugacy classes and centralizers in groups of type G2 which we use to calculate
conjugacy classes of centralizers in Section 8.5. The preliminaries for this chapter
have been discussed in Chapter 3. The results in Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 have

appeared in [ST1] and the results in 8.5 are the part of [Si].

8.1. Reality in G2

Let G be a group of type G2 defined over a field k (of characteristic 4 2). Then,
there exists an octonion algebra € over k such that G = Aut(€) ([Se], Chapter HI,
Proposition 5, Corollary). Let to be an element of G(k). We will also denote the
image of to in Aut(€) by tp. We write €p for the subspace of trace 0 elements of €.
In this section, we explore the condition so that to is conjugate to to 1 in G(k). We

prove the following,

Theorem 8.1.1. Let G be a group of type G2 over a field k of characteristic not
2 and 3. Let ty € G(k). Then, to is real in G(k) if and only if to is strongly real in
G(k).

In fact the result is true in characteristic 3 also except for unipotent elements. We
let Vi, = ker(to — 1)8. Then V;, is a composition subalgebra of € with norm as the
restriction of the norm on € ([W2]). Let r,, = dim(V;,M €o). Then 1; is 1,3 or
7. We note that if r;, = 7, the characteristic polynomial of to is (X — 1)® and tg is

unipotent. We have,

Lemma 8.1.2. Let tp) € G(k) be a unipotent element. In addition, we assume
char(k) #3. Then to is strongly real in G(k).

Proof. Since tp is unipotent, we have r;, = 7. In this case, the characteristic
polynomial of to on €p is (X — 1)". The assertion follows from a theorem of Wonen-
burger ([W2], Theorem 4), which states that if char(k) # 3 and the characteristic
