8.5. CENTRALIZERS IN ANISOTROPIC G2 83

discussed in previous paragraph and in Lemma 8.5.3 hence we assume that X — 1 is

not a factor of y4(X). For other elements we have,

Lemma 8.5.5. With notation as above, let t € G(€/L). Suppose 1 is not a root
of xa(X). Then, Z(t) c G(€/L).

Proof. Let t € G(€/L) be such that t does not fix any point in L+. Let g € Z(t)
then g € G(€,L) & SU(L+,h)» < p > where p is an extension of conjugation on
L (Proposition 3.2.5). We denote the matrix of t in SU(H) by A. Then, either
g € SU(L+,b) or g = hp for some h € SU(L+,h). When g € SU(L+,h) we denote
the matrix of g by C. Then g € Zc(t) implies AC = CA in SU(H). When g = hp
we denote the matrix of h by B and we denote the action of p on elements of L by

at a. Then,
gt(aya + agb+a3c) = hpt(aya+agb+ a3c) = hp(a,Aa + a2Ab + a3Ac)
= h(a@,Aa + Ab + @3Ac) = @,BAa + GB Ab + &3B Ac

and

 

tg(aya + agb+a3c) = thp(aiat agb + a3c) = th(aa + Gb + 3c)
= t(a, Ba + Q2Bb + a3 Bc) = a, ABa + Q2ABb + a3ABc.

As g € Z(t), above calculation implies AB = BA where B € SU(H). Suppose Zg(t)
is not contained in G(€/L). Then there exist g = hp € G(€,L) such that gt = tg.
With calculations above if we denote the matrix of h by B in SU(H), we get AB = BA
in SU(H). In this case the characteristic polynomial y4(X) = X°— aX? +aX —-1
will have a = @. But y4(X) = X?— aX? +aX —1=(X —-1)(X?4+(1—a)X +1) is
reducible and A has 1 as an eigenvalue. Which contradicts the assumption that 1 is
not a root of y4(X). Hence Z(t) C G(€/L).

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remark 8.5.6. In view of above calculations we observe that the centralizer of
t € G(€/L) in G is isomorphic to {B € SU(H) | AB = BA}U{Be SU(H) | AB=
BA}.

Let t € G(€/L) and let A € SU(H) be the corresponding matrix. Moreover we
assume that 1 is not a root of y4(X). Let K be an algebraic closure of k containing
L. As t is semisimple we have following cases:

(1) The characteristic polynomial of A has distinct roots over Kk.
(2) The characteristic polynomial of A has two distinct roots over K which

belong to k.
