52 7. REALITY IN CLASSICAL GROUPS

Proof. We note that Iso(D,a) = {x € D | xo(x) = 1} C D*. Hence the result

follows from previous theorem.

 

 

 

 

We remark that in view of Proposition 1.3.3 the group Iso(D,c), for o of the first
kind, is a form of orthogonal group. The group Iso(D,o), for o of the second kind, is

a form of unitary group.

7.4. Orthogonal Groups

Let V be a vector space over k with a nondegenerate quadratic form Q. We
denote the orthogonal group by O(Q). Wonenburger proved ([W1], Theorem 2; see
also [E12] and [E13])

Proposition 7.4.1. Any element of the orthogonal group O(Q) is strongly real,
i.e., the group O(Q) is bireflectional. Hence every element of O(Q) is real.

Djokovié extended this result ({D], Theorem 1) to fields of characteristic 2. However,

Kniippel and Nielsen proved ([KN], Theorem A),

Proposition 7.4.2. The group SO(Q) is trireflectional, except when dim(V) =
2 and V #4 H3, where Hz is the hyperbolic plane over F3. The group SO(Q) is
bireflectional if and only if dim(V) #2 (mod 4) or V = Hz, and hence in this case

every element is real.

They give necessary and sufficient condition for an element in special orthogonal

group to be strongly real ([KN], Proposition 3.3).

Proposition 7.4.3. Let t € SO(Q). Then t is strongly real in SO(Q) if and
only if dim(V) # 2 (mod 4) or an orthogonal decomposition of V into orthogonally

indecomposable t-modules contains an odd dimensional summand.

In the case dim(V) = 2 (mod 4), we explore reality for semisimple elements in
SO(Q). First we prove,

Lemma 7.4.4. Lett € SO(Q) where dim(V) = 2 (mod 4). Lett be a semisimple
element which has only two distinct eigenvalues \ and \~* (hence \ # +1) over k.
Then t is not real in SO(Q).

 

Proof. We prove that the element ¢ is not real over k. Let dim(V) = 2m where
m is odd. The element t over k is conjugate to A = diag(A,...,,A71,..., 71)
