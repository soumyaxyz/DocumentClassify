74 8. REALITY IN GROUPS OF TYPE G2

Proof. Let b € k* such that b? ¢ N(E*). Consider D = diag(b, 1,1), a diagonal
matrix and put A= DSD~-!. Then A € SL(3). We claim that A is not a product of
two symmetric matrices from SL(3). Assume the contrary. Suppose A = DSD-! =
S19 where S;,S € SL(3) and symmetric. Then

A=DSD7' = (DSD)D~ = §,S».
Let T; = DSD, T: = D~?. Then 'T; = T;, i =1,2 and A = 7,T2 = SS. Therefore,
4 = ToT, = TAT, | = S28, = 82 AS5'.
Since the characteristic polynomial of A is irreducible, by the proof of Theorem 8.3.6,
D?S, = Ty'S, € Z(A) = k[A] & E. Which implies S, = D~?f(A) for some
polynomial f(X) € k[X]. Taking determinants, we get
1 = det Sy = det D~? det(f(A)),

ie., b? = det(f(A)) € N(£*), contradicting the choice of b € k. Hence A can not be

written as a product of two symmetric matrices from S'L(3).

 

 

 

8.4. Examples of Nonreal Elements

 

In this section we produce examples of nonreal semisimple elements in groups o
type Gy. In [W2] and [L]}, there are examples of elements which are product of three
involutions but not two. These are examples of nonreal elements. First we produce
nonreal semisimple elements which are product of three involutions but not two in
G2, over number fields and over fields Q and Q,. In the view of Theorem 8.1.7 these
elements are not real. We also produce examples of nonreal elements in G» over finite
fields. Note that over finite fields every semisimple as well as unipotent element is
real. Hence the elements produced are of mixed kind, i.e., neither semisimple nor

unipotent.

8.4.1. Nonreal Elements in G, over Number Fields. We use Proposition 8.2.14
to construct non-real elements in G2 over number fields and use the notation intro-

duced there.

Lemma 8.4.1. Let k be a number field and L a quadratic field extension of k. Let
F be a cyclic extension of degree 3 over k. Let us denote E = F.L. Then L'/Npj,(E")

is nontrivial.

Proof. The proof follows by looking at a place of E over L which is unramified

 

 

 

of degree 3.
