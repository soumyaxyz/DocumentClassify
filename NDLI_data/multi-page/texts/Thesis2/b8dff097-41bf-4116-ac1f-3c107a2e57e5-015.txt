CHAPTER 1

Classical Groups

In this chapter we give a brief introduction to classical groups. For the classical
theory of forms and their isometry groups, we refer the reader to the books by E.
Artin ([A]) and L. C. Grove ({G]) on the subject. For a modern account of the
subject, we refer to the book [KMRT]. Let k be a field. Let V be a vector space of
dimension n over k. We denote the set of all linear automorphisms of V by GL(V).
The set GL(V) is a group under the multiplication defined by composition of maps.
Let B = {e1,...,é€n} be a basis of V. Then we can identify GL(V) with GL,(k) =
{A € M,,(k) | det(A) 4 0}, the set of all nx n invertible matrices. This group is called
the general linear group. The linear automorphisms, which have determinant 1,
constitute a subgroup of GL(V), denoted by SL(V). The corresponding matrix group
is denoted by SL,,(k) = {A € M,,(k) | det(A) = 1}. This group is called the special
linear group .

1.1. Bilinear Forms and Hermitian Forms

Let V be a vector space of dimension n over a field k. A map b: V x V > k is

called a bilinear form if
b(ax + by,z) = ab(x,z) + bb(y, z)
6(x,ay+bz) = ab(x,y) + bb(x, z)

 

for all z,y,z € V anda,bek.

Definition 1.1.1. A bilinear form 6 is called symmetric if b(x,y) = b(y,x)
for all z,y € V. A bilinear form 6 is called skew-symmetric or symplectic if
6(x,v) =O forallaeV.

Let 6 be a bilinear form on V. Let {e1,...,@n} be a basis of V over k. Then there
exists a matrix B such that (x, y) = “By. The matrix B has 6(e;, e;) as its ij entry.
Note that a bilinear form b is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric) if and only if
the corresponding matrix B is symmetric, i.e., B = ‘B (respectively skew-symmetric,
ie., ‘B = —B), with respect to any fixed basis of V.
