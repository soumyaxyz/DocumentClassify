2.4. ROOT DATUM AND REDUCTIVE GROUPS 15

Section 7.1). That is, we have
g= B Ba
acx
where

Ga = {2 € g| Ad(t)(x) = a(t)a Vt € T}.
The subspaces gq are called weight spaces and any non-zero vector in it is called
weight vector. The zero weight space is exactly the Lie algebra t of J’. We write
® = {a € X(T) | ga £ O} and denote the lattice (subgroup) generated by ® in X(T)
by Q. We list some properties here and refer to [Sp], Corollary 8.1.2 for the proofs.
We have,

(1) Each g, for a € ® is one-dimensional and a € @ if and only if -a € ®.
(2) The group W, Weyl group, acts naturally on X(T’) and leaves © invariant.
(3) Let E = R®zQ. Then (£, ®) is an abstract root system (see [Sp], Section
7.4).
A semisimple group can be determined by its root system (£,®) and the funda-
mental group X/Q. In view of Proposition 2.3.2 it is enough to classify simple
groups. Simple groups correspond to irreducible root systems which eventually can

be classified as one of the following types:

A,(n 2 1), Br(n 2 2),C,(n 2 3), D,(n 2 4), Ey, Ex, Es, Fi, Gy.

The groups SL,(k) for n > 1, SOen+41(q) for n > 2, Spon(k) for n > 3 and SOo,(q) for
n > 4 over k, introduced in the Chapter 1, are the groups of type Ap(n > 1), Ba(n >
2),C,(n > 3), D,(n > 4) respectively. To determine reductive groups one needs more
data which we describe below.

Let us consider the Borel subgroups (a maximal connected closed solvable sub-
group) of G containing a fixed maximal torus T. They are all conjugate under the
action of N(T’) and in fact, W acts simply transitively on this set ({Sp], Corollary
6.4.12). Let B be a Borel subgroup of G containing T. Then B = U x T where
U = R,(B). The group G has a unique Borel subgroup B-, called opposite Borel,
containing T such that BN B~ = T. We have B~ = UT where U- = R,(B-) ({Sp],
Lemma 8.1.4). The subgroups U and U~ are connected unipotent groups normalized
by T (in fact, maximal unipotent subgroups of G) and UM U~ = 1. Let us denote
the cocharacter group Hom(G,,,T) of T by Y(T). Then Y(T) = Z’ where r is the
rank of G. We get a pairing:
