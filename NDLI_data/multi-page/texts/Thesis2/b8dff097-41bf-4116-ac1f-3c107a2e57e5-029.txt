CHAPTER 3
Groups of Type G»

In this chapter we describe the groups of type G2 over a field k. The fact that all
groups of type G2 can be described this way follows from the computation of Galois
Cohomology for G2 in the next chapter (see Corollary 4.3.5). We shall discuss Galois
Cohomology in the next chapter. For the exposition in this chapter we follow the
book [SV]. Results in this chapter are used later in the proof of one of the main
theorems. Several results are taken from [J], [W2] and [L] and modified suitably to

fulfil our requirements.

3.1. The Group G) and Octonions

We begin by a brief introduction to the group G2. Any group G of type G2 over a
given field k can be realized as the group of k-automorphisms of an octonion algebra
over k, determined uniquely by G. We will need the notion of a composition algebra

over a field k.

Definition 3.1.1. A composition algebra € over a field k is an algebra over k,
not necessarily associative, with an identity element 1 together with a nondegenerate
quadratic form N on €, permitting composition, ie., N(ay) = N(«)N(y) Va,y€ €.

The quadratic form N is called the norm on €. The associated bilinear form N is
given by: N(a,y) = N(#+y) — N(x) — N(y). Every element x of € satisfies the
equation «2 — N(x,1)x + N(x)1 = 0. There is an involution (anti automorphism of
order 2) on € defined by = N(x, 1)1—2. We call N(x,1)1 = «+7, the trace of z.
The possible dimensions of a composition algebra over k are 1,2,4,8. Composition
algebras of dimension 1 or 2 are commutative and associative, those of dimension
4 are associative but not commutative (called quaternion algebras), and those of
dimension 8 are neither commutative nor associative (called octonion algebras or
Cayley algebra).

Let € be an octonion algebra and G = Aut(€) be the automorphism group
of €. Since any automorphism of an octonion algebra leaves the norm invariant,
Aut(€) is a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(€, NV). In fact, the automorphism
