9.3. Reality over Fields of cd(k) <1

In this section we discuss reality for semisimple elements over fields of cd(k) < 1.

We have,

Theorem 9.3.1. Let k be a field with cd(k) < 1. Let G be a connected reductive
group defined over k with —1 in its Weyl group. Then every semisimple element in
G(k) is real in G(k).

Proof. Let t € G(k) be semisimple. Let T be a maximal torus defined over k
with t € T(k). Then the Weyl group W = N(T)/T, where N(T) is the normalizer of

T in G. We have the exact sequence
13-T>N(T)—-W 1.

The corresponding Galois cohomology sequence is

 

1— T(k) — N(T)(k) — W(k) — H*(k,T)

Since cd(k) < 1, by Steinberg’s theorem ([S1], Theorem 1.9), H1(k,T) = 0. Hence
the longest element wo in the Weyl group, which acts by —1 on the set of roots, lifts to
an element h € N(T)(k). Hence hth! = t-! with h € G(k) and t is real in G(k).

 

 

 

 

Corollary 9.3.2. Let G and k be as in the above theorem. Then every regular

element of G is real.

Proof. Let g € G be regular and g = gsg, be the Jordan decomposition of g in
G with g, semisimple and g,, unipotent. Then, by the above theorem, hg,h~! = gy!

for some h € G. Then hg,h~! and gy!

are regular unipotents in Zq(g,)° and hence
there is 7 € Z¢(gs) such that xhg,h-!a~! = g7!. Then (ah)g(xh)-! = g! and hence

g is real (see [SS], Corollary 1.9, Chapter IIH).

 

 

 

 

Theorem 9.3.3. Let k be a field with cd(k) < 1 (e.g. algebraically closed fields
and finite fields etc.). Let G be a simple adjoint group defined over k. Suppose that
the longest element wo in the Weyl group of G with respect to a maximal torus T acts

as —1 on the roots. Then every semisimple element in G(k) is strongly real in G(k).

Proof. Let t € G(k) be a semisimple element. Let T be a torus in G defined over
k which contains t, i.e., t € T(k). From a theorem of Richardson and Springer ({RS],
Proposition 8.22), as —1 € W, there exists no € N(T) with n3 = 1 which represents
