84 8. REALITY IN GROUPS OF TYPE G2

We calculate centralizers in these cases. We observe that whenever H is a connected
subgroup of a connected algebraic group G and t € H such that Zg(t) C H then t
is regular in G if and only if it is so in H. Hence t € G(€/L) is regular in G(€/L)
if and only if it is regular in G (Lemma 8.5.5). This implies that any element of
G(€/L) (which does not have 1 as an eigenvalue) is either a regular element in G or
its characteristic polynomial is (X —a)(X — 3)? where a, 3 are in L—k. We calculate

centralizers of these elements here.

Lemma 8.5.7. Let t © G = Aut(€). With notation as above let t © G(€/L)
and A be the corresponding element in SU(H). Suppose 1 is not an eigenvalue of A.

Then the centralizer of t is a maximal torus in G or it is isomorphic to a subgroup

Proof. When the element ¢ is regular the centralizer is a maximal torus in G
and hence the conjugacy of centralizers of these elements correspond to conjugacy
classes of maximal tori of G over k. Now suppose the characteristic polynomial
xa(X) has multiple roots, i-e., y4(X) = (X — a)(X — 8)? where a, @ € L both not
equal to 1 and the minimal polynomial is (X — a)(X — 3). Then we can choose a
basis of Z+ consisting of eigenvectors v1, v2,v3 corresponding to eigenvalues a, 3, 3
of t. We denote the subspace generated by v2,v3 as W. The matrix of t is diag-
onal with respect to this basis, A = diag{a, 3,3}. As 1 is not a root of y4(X)
the centralizer Z(t) = Zsuim(A) which is isomorphic to Zgp(r)(A) A SU(H) =

8.5.1. Conjugacy Classes of Centralizers in Compact G». Let G be the
compact real group of type G2. We note that for the base field k = R there is a unique
anisotropic form of G2. As there is a unique nondegenerate anisotropic quadratic form
over R of dimension 8, there is a unique octonion division algebra (up to isomorphism)
€ over R and G = Aut(€). We calculate centralizers of elements and there conjugacy
classes in this case. Let € be the octonion division algebra over R and G = Aut(€).
Let t € G. Let L be a quadratic field extension of R left fixed pointwise by t (which
is isomorphic to C). Then t € SU(L+,h) © SU(3) = {A € GL3(C) | AA = 1}. We
also note that all quadratic field extensions of R contained in € are isomorphic hence

all subgroups of type SU(L+,) are conjugate (Proposition 3.2.9) in G. But every
