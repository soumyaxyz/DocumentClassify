8.2. SU(V,5) CG 67

Corollary 8.2.5. Let A € SU(H) with characteristic polynomial x 4(X) over
L same as its minimal polynomial. Then, A = B, By with B,, By € U(H) and
BiB, == BoBo.

From this corollary, we get the following,

Lemma 8.2.6. Let A € SU(H), with characteristic polynomial over L equal to
its minimal polynomial. Then,
(1) A is conjugate to A~! in U(H), if and only if A= Ay Az with A,, Ay € U(#)
and A, A, =I = AgAp.
(2) A is conjugate to A~! in SU(H), if and only if A = A,Ay with Ay, Ao €
SU(H) and A, A; = I = Ag Ag.

The following proposition is due to Neumann ([N], Lemma 5). Recall that we
have fixed a basis {f1, fo, fs} for V = L+ over L in Theorem 8.2.2.

Proposition 8.2.7. Let € be an octonion algebra over k and let L be a quadratic
field extension of k, which is a subalgebra of €. An element t € G(€/L) is a product
of two involutions in Aut(€), if and only if, the corresponding matrix A € SU(H) is
a product of two matrices A,, Ag € SU(H), satisfying AyA, = ApAg = I.

We now have,

Theorem 8.2.8. Let ty be an element in G(€/L) which does not have a fixed
point outside L and let A denote the image of to in SU(H). Suppose the characteristic
polynomial of A is equal to its minimal polynomial over L. Then to is conjugate to

tp’, if and only if to is a product of two involutions in G(k).

Proof. From Theorem 8.2.2 we have, to is conjugate to to', if and only if A is
conjugate to A~! in SU(H). From Lemma 8.2.6 above, A is conjugate to A~! in
SU(H) if and only if A = Ay Ay with Ay, Ay € SU(H) and A, A; = I = ApAy. Now,

from Proposition 8.2.7, it follows that to is a product of two involutions.

 

 

 

 

In [W2] and [L] examples of elements in G(k), for G of type Ge, are constructed,
which are not product of two involutions. These examples are neither semisimple
nor unipotent. However, we continue our analysis to produce examples of semisimple
elements which are not real. Let V be a vector space over L of dimension n together
with a nondegenerate hermitian form h. Let A € SU(H). Let us denote the conjugacy
class of A in U(H) by C and the centralizer of A in U(H) by Z and let

La = {det(X) | X € Z}.
