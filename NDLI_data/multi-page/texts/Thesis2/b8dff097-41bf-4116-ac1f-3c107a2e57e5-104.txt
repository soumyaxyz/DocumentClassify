92 9. REALITY IN ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

—lin W. That is, we have nosng | =s7! for alls € T. We claim that the coset noT
is T-stable. We note that for ¢ €¢ P = Gal(k/k),

a(no)sa(no)~* = (nga (s)ng!) = (a7 (s71)) = 8?

for alls € T anda € T. Hence o(no) € N(T) also represents —1 in W. Thus we
have o(no)T = noT and so ngo(no) € T.

We look at the cocycle defined by o +> noa(no). Then the image of this cocycle
lands in T. Since cd(k) < 1, from a theorem of Steinberg ([S1], Theorem 1.9) we have
H'(k,T) =0 and hence the cocycle defined above is a trivial cocycle. That is, there
exists tg € T such that noo(no) = toa(tg’) for all o € . This implies o(noto) = noto
for allo € T and hence noto € G(k). We check that noto is an involution and

conjugates every element of T to its inverse.

(noto)? = Notonoto = toto = 1
and

notos(noto) > = notosty no = nosno = st.

 

 

 

Hence every semisimple element of G(k) is real in G(k).
