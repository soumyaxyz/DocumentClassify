where aabbcé = —1. Suppose T? = 1. Then aa = 1, bb = 1,c@ = 1. This implies that
aabbcé = 1, a contradiction. Hence there is no involution in SLe¢(k) conjugating S' to
Sie, S is real semisimple but not strongly real in SL¢(k).

2. Let us take A = oil a unipotent element in SL2(k). Then any element

X € GL2(k) such that X AX! = A7! has the form X = ( ) y ) Then, A is

conjugate to A! in SL2(k) if and only if —1 is a square in k. In that case (—1 is a
square in k) the element X which conjugates A to its inverse satisfies X? = —1, not

an involution, and hence A is not strongly real in SL(k).

7.2. Groups of Type A,

In this section we study real semisimple elements in SLo(k) and PSL2(k) =
SLo(k)/Z(SLo(k)). We fix an algebraic closure k of k. Let G = SLo(k). We fix the
maximal torus T = {diag(a,a7!) |a € k*} in G.

Lemma 7.2.1. With notation as above, every semisimple element of G = SL2(k)
is real in G. The only involutions in G are {I,—-I}, hence non-central semisimple
elements are not a product of involutions. Moreover, every semisimple element of
G is conjugate to its inverse by an involution in GLo(k), hence is strongly real in
GL4(k).

Proof. Let t € SL2(k) be semisimple. First, assume that t = diag(a,a7') € T.

Now let n = tor Then we have, for any t € T, ntn7

involution with det(n) = —1. Hence, for any t € 7’, we have t = n.nt, a product

of two involutions in GLo(k). Now, if s € SLe(k) is semisimple then gsg7! € T for
some g € SLa(k). If gsg~! = pipe, p; € GL2(k), pp = 1, then s = g™'pig.g7! pag, an

Corollary 7.2.2. Let G = PSL2(k) and t be a semisimple element in G. Then t

is real in G if and only if t is strongly real in G.
