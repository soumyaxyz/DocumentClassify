48 7. REALITY IN CLASSICAL GROUPS

consider the following cases. Let S be a cyclic linear transformation on a vector space

W with self reciprocal characteristic polynomial y5(X), of the following two kinds;

(1) the degree of xs(X) is even, say 2m,

(2) xs(X) = (X — 1)? or (X 4:1)?7™41,
We claim that in the first case S is conjugate to S~! by an involution whose determi-
nant is (—1)™. And in the second case there are involutions with determinant (—1)”
or (-1)™*! conjugating S to S71.
Case 1. Since W is cyclic, there is a vector u € W such that € = {u, Su,...,S?”-tu}
is a basis of W. By substituting Su = y we get € = {S-™y,...,y,...,S™ ty}. Let

B={y,(S+S)y,...,(S™ 1 +5 )y, (S — Sy, ...,(S" — S™)y}.

Then B is a basis of W. We denote the subspace generated by the first m vectors of
B by P and the latter m vectors by Q. Then $+ S71 leaves P as well as Q invariant.
Also (S — S7')(P) = Q and (S — S~!)(Q) C P. Let H = 1]p ®—1\g. Then H is an
involution which conjugates S to S~1 and has determinant (—1)”.

Case 2. In this case, we have the characteristic polynomial ys(X) = (X — ¢)?”*1

 

where € = +1. Since W is cyclic, there is a vector u € W such that € = {u, Su,...,S?™u}

is a basis. By substituting S”u = y we get E = {S-™y,...,y,..., Sy}. As in the
previous case, we consider the basis

B= {y,(S+ Sy... (S™+5-)y,(S— Sy... (S™ = S-™)y}.

We denote the subspace generated by the first m+ 1 vectors of B by P and the latter
m vectors by Q. Then $+S7! leaves P as well as Q invariant. Also (S—S-')(P) CQ
and (S—S71)(Q) c P. We consider H, = 1|p6—1|g and Hy = —1|p@1|g. Then My

and Hz both are involutions which conjugate S to S~! and have determinants (—1)”

 

 

 

and (—1)"*? respectively.

 

Remarks 7.1.3. 1. An element S$ = diag(a,aq', 8,871, 7,7!) € SLe(k) such

that all the diagonal entries are distinct, can be conjugated to its inverse by
