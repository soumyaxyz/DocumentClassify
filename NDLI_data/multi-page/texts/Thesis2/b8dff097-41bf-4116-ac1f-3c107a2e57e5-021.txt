1.3. ALGEBRAS WITH INVOLUTIONS AND CLASSICAL GROUPS 9

One can define adjoint involutions corresponding to hermitian forms as well. Let
F be a central simple algebra over a field k and let V be a finitely generated left E

module. Let 6: E — E be an involution on E.

Definition 1.3.4. A hermitian form on V is a bi-additive map
§:VxVOE
such that
(i) b(ax, By) = ab(x, y)0(3) for all z,y eV anda, Ge E,
(ii) 6(y, x) = O(6(x, y)) for all x,y eV.

The hermitian form on the left E-module V is called nondegenerate if the only
element x € V such that (a, y) =0 for all y € V is x = 0. For every nondegenerate
hermitian form h on V, there exists a unique involution o, on Endg(V) such that
o4(a) = O(a) for all a € k and

h(x, fly) = hlow(f\(a),y) for a,y € V.
The involution oy is called the adjoint involution with respect to §. In this case the

isometry group Iso(Endg(V),h) is denoted by U(V, 6).
