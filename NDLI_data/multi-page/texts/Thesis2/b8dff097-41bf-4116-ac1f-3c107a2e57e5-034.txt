the split subalgebra is the diagonal subalgebra. We consider the map p on € given by

and it is an automorphism of €, with p? = 1.

Proposition 3.2.3. Let € be the split octonion algebra as above and let L be the

diagonal split quadratic étale subalgebra. Then we have,
G(¢, L) = G(€/L) x H,
where H is the order two group generated by p.

Proof. Let h € G(€,L). Then h|;, = 1 or the nontrivial k-automorphism of L.
In the first case, h € G(€/L) and, in the second, hp € G(€/L). Hence h = gp for
some g € G(€/L). Moreover, it is clear that H normalizes G(€/L) in Aut(€). Since
HO G(€/L) = {1}, we get the required result.

 

 

 

 

We now give a general construction of the automorphism p of an octonion algebra
€, not necessarily split, as above. We first recall the Cayley-Dickson Doubling for
composition algebras :

Proposition 3.2.4. Let € be a composition algebra and D C € a composition

subalgebra, D # €. Leta € D+ with N(a) = -—A #0. ThenD, =DO Da is a

composition subalgebra of € of dimension 2dim(D). The product on D, is given by:
(x + ya)(u+ va) = (wu + Ady) + (va + yU)a, X,y,u,v ED,

where x +> & is the involution on D. The norm on D, is given by N(a + ya) =

N(x) — AN (y).

Let € be an octonion algebra and L C €, a quadratic composition subalgebra of €.
Let a € L+ with N(a) 4 0. Let 9 = L @ La be the double as described above. Then
® is a quaternion subalgebra of €. Define p1: D — D by pi(a + ya) = o(x) + o(y)a,
where o denotes the nontrivial automorphism of L. Then ; is an automorphism of

®, and clearly pj = 1 and pi|, = 0. We now repeat this construction with respect to
®D and p,. Write € = D © Db for some b E D+, N(b) #0. Define p: € > € by,

p(x + yb) = pi(x) + pily)d.
