and s* = —1. This concludes the proof of the theorem over k.

We now complete the proof over k. Let t € Sp(V), where V is a 2n-dimensional
vector space over k. We first assume ¢ is real in Sp(V).

First note that if t; € Sp(V,) and ty € Sp(V2), where V, and V, are vector space
over k of dimension 2n; and 2nz respectively, and if there exist g, € Sip(Vi) and
go € Sp(V) such that g;tig;' = t;' and g? = —1, then t, © ty is conjugate to its
inverse t;' Oty! by g = 91 O go in Sp(Vi @ Vo) and g? = —1.

Now let t € Sp(V) be real. We write V for V @k and V, = {a € V | t(x) = az},
where a € k*. Both VY, and V_; are defined over k. Let the subspaces V, and

V_1 of V be the descents of V; and V_; respectively. We note that the dimension

 

of V_, is even, since the determinant of t is 1. We now assume a 4 £1. We write
Wa = Va ®V_-1, which is a nondegenerate subspace of V. The subspace W, is defined
over the subfield ky of k, where kg is the fixed field of the subgroup of I = Gal(k/k)
fixing the unordered pair {a,a~'}. We denote the descent subspace of Wa over ka
by W,. Then W, is a direct sum of m, two-dimensional subspaces over ka, which are
stable under ¢ and ¢ restricted to each of these 2-dimensional subspace is conjugate
to diag{a,a7t}.

By Lemma 7.5.1, there exists gq € Sp(W.) with g2 = —1 such that gatlw.ga! =
thy. The subspace Wra = @cerWoa is defined over k and we denote the restriction

of t to this subspace by tra (which is ®certsa). Also gra = PGca is defined over k

and conjugates t to t~! on the subspace Wry. We note that the g2,, = —1.
Now we write V = Vi @V_1 Dacg Wra- Since the dimension of V_; is even, we may
. 0 -1 . . :
take g_; as the direct sum of N = i 0 on this subspace, 3 dim(V_1) times.

Since n is even, dimension of V; is even and we may take g; as the direct sum of N,
3 dim(V,) times, on this subspace. Finally we take g = 91 ®9-1 Pack Gra € Sp(2n, k).
We have g? = —1 and gtg-t = t71.
