where « € T. Then g? = hrhx = —hrh a a-!a = —I and this proves the

 

 

 

required result.

 

We now consider Q, a quaternion algebra over k. It is a central simple algebra
over k of degree 2. We note that SL;(Q) = {x € Q* | Nrd(x) = 1} is a form of SL»
over k. We denote the group SL1(Q)/Z(SLi(Q)) by PSL1(Q).

Proposition 7.2.5. With notation as above, let G = PSL\(Q) andt € G be a
semisimple element. Then, t is real in PSL1(Q) if and only if t is strongly real in

PSL,(Q). Furthermore, G = SL1(Q) has real elements which are not strongly real.

Proof. We first observe that an element t € Q* is either strongly regular or

central. Proof of this fact and the rest of the proposition is on similar lines as in

 

 

 

Lemma 7.2.3 and Proposition 7.2.4.

 

7.3. SL(D), deg(D) Odd

We now consider anisotropic simple groups of type A,, for n even. These are
the groups S'Z,(D) for central division algebras of degree n + 1. Let D be a central
division algebra over a field k, with degree D odd. Let G = D* or G = SL\(D) =
{x € D* | Nrd(x) = 1}. We have,

Theorem 7.3.1. Let G be as above. Then the only real elements in G = D* are

 

+1. InG=SL,(D), there are no nontrivial real elements.

Proof. We first prove that there are no non-central real element in G and there
are no non-central involutions in G. Let t € G be a real element which is not in the
center of D. Then k(t) is a subfield # k contained in D and has a field automorphism
defined by t + t7! of order two. Hence the degree of k(t) over k is even. But degree
of D being odd, D can not contain a field extension of even degree. Hence there are
no real elements which are not in the center of G.

Now let ¢t € G is a non-central involution. Then k(t) is a field extension over k
of even degree. Following similar argument as in the previous paragraph, we get a

contradiction. Hence any involution in G is in the center of G. Since D is central an

 

 

 

 

degree D is odd, any such involution is trivial. This completes the proof.

Corollary 7.3.2. Let D be a central division algebra over a field k, with degree
D odd. Let o be an involution on D. Then the group Iso(D,o) has no nontrivial real

elements.
