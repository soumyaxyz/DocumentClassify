“MATHEMATICS IS ALWAYS A CONTINUUM, LINKED TO ITS HIS-
TORY, THE PAST - NOTHING COMES OUT OF ZERO........ A THEOREM
IS NEVER ARRIVED AT IN THE WAY THAT LOGICAL THOUGHT WOULD
LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE OR THAT POSTERITY THINKS. IT IS USUALLY
MUCH MORE ACCIDENTAL, SOME CHANCE DISCOVERY IN ANSWER TO
SOME KIND OF QUESTION. EVENTUALLY YOU CAN RATIONALIZE IT
AND SAY THAT THIS IS HOW IT FITS. DISCOVERIES NEVER HAP-
PEN AS NEATLY AS THAT. YOU CAN REWRITE HISTORY AND MAKE
IT LOOK MUCH MORE LOGICAL, BUT ACTUALLY IT HAPPENS QUITE
DIFFERENTLY.....”
