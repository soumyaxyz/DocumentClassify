is called totally isotropic if W = W+. A subspace W is nondegenerate if the form

6 restricted to W is nondegenerate.

Lemma 1.1.3. Let (V,6) be a symmetric, symplectic or a hermitian space. Let
W be a subspace. Then,
(1) dim(V) = dim(W) + dim(W+) and
(2) V=W OW? if and only if the form 6 restricted to W is nondegenerate.

This Lemma is useful in determining whether a subspace is nondegenerate. Let
W, and W, be two subspaces of V. We call V is orthogonal sum of W, and W 2
if V = Wi © Wo and b(wi,we) = 0 Vw, € W, and wo € We. We denote it by
V=WiOWy,.

We will need the notion of tensor product of bilinear forms. Let (V;,6,) and
(V2, 62) be vector spaces over k with bilinear forms. We define 6; ® bg, a bilinear form
on Vj ® Va, by

6, @ bo(v, @ v2, W1 ® we) = by (v1, Wi) b2(ve, we).

If 6; and bg both are symmetric then the form 6; ® bg is symmetric. Hence we have
notion of tensor product of quadratic forms. Let (Vi, qi) and (V2, q2) be quadratic

spaces over k. Then (Vi ® V2, q1 @ q2) is a quadratic space where qi ® qo(v) @ v2) =
qi (v1)42(v2).

1.2. Isometry Groups

Let (V,6) be a space with form 6 which is either symmetric, skew symmetric or
hermitian. An element T € GL(V) is called an isometry if 6(Tz,Ty) = 6(2,y)
for all z,y € V. If the form b is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric or her-
mitian) the group of isometries is called orthogonal (respectively symplectic or
unitary) group of (V,6) denoted by O(V,6) (respectively Sp(V,6),U(V,6)). Let
6 be a skew-symmetric form on V. An element T € GL(V) is called a skew-
symplectic isometry if 6(T7,Ty) = —b(«,y) for all ,y € V. The orthogonal
group is also denoted by O(V,q), where q is the corresponding quadratic form. The
group SO(V,6) = {T € O(V,6) | det(Z) = 1} is called the special orthogonal
group and the group SU(V,6) = {7 € U(V,6) | det(T) = 1} is called the special
unitary group.

In the matrix notation, we fix a basis of V and denote the matrix of b by B.

The matrix groups corresponding to the orthogonal group, symplectic group and the
