s € Sp(4,k) such that s? = —1. Hence a semisimple element of PSp(4,k) is real if
and only if it is strongly real in PSp(4, k).

Proof. Let J = diag (( : 7 ; ( : 4 )). Then Sp(4,k) = {A € GL(4,k) |

AJA = J}. We first assume t is conjugate to t-!. We may assume t = diag(\, A71, uw, 71).

We let

Then g? = —1 and gtg"! =t7!.
Now let ¢ be conjugate to —t~!. Then we may assume ¢ = diag(\, A7?, —A, —A7?).

Theorem 7.5.3. Let t € Sp(2n,k) be a semisimple element. Suppose t is either
conjugate to t-' or —t~'. Then the conjugation can be achieved by an element s €
Sp(2n,k) such that s? = —1. Hence a semisimple element of PSip(2n,k) is real if
and only if it is strongly real in PSp(2n,k).

Proof. First we consider semisimple elements in Sp(2n,k). Let t € Sp(2n,k) be
semisimple with t conjugate to t~!. Then t can be conjugated to diag(A;, \y',..., An; An?)
and this diagonal element can be conjugated to its inverse by s = diag(N,...,N)

—1
where N = ( : i ) . Clearly s? = —1. A conjugate of s then does the job.

Now let us assume t is conjugate to —t~! in Sp(2n,k). Then t can be conjugated
