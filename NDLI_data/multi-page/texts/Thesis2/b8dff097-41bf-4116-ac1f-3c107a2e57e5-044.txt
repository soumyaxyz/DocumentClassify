32 4. GALOIS COHOMOLOGY

Ox(q), is the orthogonal group of the form over K. We have ({Se], Chapter III,
Section 1.2, Proposition 4),

Corollary 4.3.2. The set H'(G,Ox(q)) is in bijective correspondence with the

set of classes of quadratic k-forms that are K-isomorphic to q.

If we take b a nondegenerate alternating (symplectic) form as a tensor then we
get ({Se], Chapter HI, Section 1.2, Proposition 3),

Corollary 4.3.3. H!(G, Sp2,(b)) = {1}.

Now we choose V an algebraic variety (e.g. an algebraic group) defined over k. As
before we take kK an extension of k and denote by Ax the group of K-automorphisms
of Vx. Now let K/k be a Galois extension and let V’ be a K/k-form of V. The
set P of K-isomorphisms of Vz over Vix is obviously a principal homogeneous space
over the Gal(//k)-group A() = Auty (x). Hence we get a canonical map as before
({Se], Chapter HI, Section 1.3, Proposition 5 and Corollary):

6: E(K/k) > H}(K/k, Auty).

Proposition 4.3.4. The map 6 is injective. If V is a quasiprojective, it is bijec-

tive. Hence if V ts an algebraic group, the map @ ts bijective.

Corollary 4.3.5. The K/k-forms of simple groups of type Gz is in one-one corre-
spondence with K/k-forms of octonion algebras. Also, K/k-forms of classical groups
with trivial center is in one-one correspondence with K/k-forms of semisimple alge-

bras with involution.

Let Q be a quaternion algebra over k. We associate a group SL,(Q) to it which
is a k-form of SL» and the rational points of this group can be identified with the
elements of Q with reduced norm 1.

We mention here a theorem about an algebraic group over field with cd(k) < 1.
This theorem is due to Steinberg ([S1], Theorem 1.9; [Se], Chapter III, Section 2.3,

Theorem 1’).

Theorem 4.3.6 (Steinberg). Let k be a perfect field with cd(k) < 1. Then,
H'(k, L) =0 for every connected linear group L.

If L is connected reductive group then the assumption that & is a perfect field is not

needed in this theorem.
