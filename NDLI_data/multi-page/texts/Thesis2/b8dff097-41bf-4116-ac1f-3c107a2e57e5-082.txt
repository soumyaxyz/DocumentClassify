70 8. REALITY IN GROUPS OF TYPE G2

the group of Brauer classes of central simple algebras over k, which split over F. We
define a map ¢: B(F'/k) —> B(E/L) by [(F,7, a)| - [(E,7,a)] (which is the same as
the map [D] + [D®L]). This map is well defined ([P], Section 15.1, Corollary c) and
is an injective map since ker(¢) = {[(F,7,a)] € B(F/k) | a € k*,a © Neyr(E*)} =
{[((F,7,a)] € B(F/k) | a € Nejx(F*)}. We have a commutative diagram,

k*/Ney(F*) > B(F/k)

| |e
L*/Nejt(E*) —> B(B/L)

The vertical maps are injective in the above diagram. We have the following exact

sequence,
1 — (Neyi(E*)k")/Nayt(E") — L*/Npyjt(E*)  LY/Ngyi(E!) — 1

where (Ngyjr(E*)k*)/Ng/r(E*) = k*/Npj,.(F*). Hence, from the commutativity of
the above diagram, we get B(E/L)/¢(B(F/k)) = L'/Npy,(E’).

This shows L'/Nz/_(£') is nontrivial, if and only if there exists a central division
algebra D over L which splits over EF and it does not come from a central division
algebra over k, split by F’. Over number field for such a construction we refer to [K]
(Chapter V, Proposition 1).

8.3. SL(3) CG

We continue here with proof of the Theorem 8.1.8. Let us assume now that
L=kxk. We have seen in Section 3.2 that G(¢€/L) = SL(U) = SL(3). Let to
be an element in G(€/L) and denote its image in SL(3) by A. We assume that the

characteristic polynomial of A € SZ(3) is equal to its minimal polynomial over k.

Lemma 8.3.1. Let the notation be fixed as above. Let to be an element in G(€/L)
which does not have a fixed point outside L. Suppose that dh € G = Aut(€), such
that htgh7! = ty'. Then h(L) = L.

Proof. Suppose that h(L) ¢ L. Then we claim that dr € LM €o such that
h(x) ¢ L. For this, let y € L be such that h(y) ¢ L. Let « = y — dtr(y)1. Then
tr(x) = 0 and if h(x) € L then h(y) € L, a contradiction. Hence we have « € LM €o
with h(x) ¢ L. Also since to(x) = x, we have,

to(h(x)) = hts*(e) = h(a).
