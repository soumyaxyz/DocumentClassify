80 8. REALITY IN GROUPS OF TYPE G2

conjugacy of t and t~1 in G(k) is equivalent to conjugacy of B and B- in SU(3),
by the same calculation as in the proof of Th. 6.5. By Lemma 8.2.6, this is if and
only if B = B, By with B; € SU(3) and B;B; = 1. But then B= DAD~! = B, By
and hence A = (D~!B,D~!)(DByD) = A, Ag, say. Then A; € U(3) and A;A; = 1.
Let C € SU(3) be such that CBC-! = B-!. Then CDAD-!C7! = DA7!D-.
This gives, (D-'CD~!)A(DC~!D) = A7!. Hence, by Lemma 8.2.6, A = T;T> with
T,; € SU(3), T;,T; =1. Therefore, by a similar argument as in the remark following
Corollary 8.2.11, we must have, T,A;! = f(A) for a polynomial f(X) € L[X]. Taking
determinants, we get b-? = f(w)°, contradicting the choice of b. Therefore ¢ is not
real in G(k).

 

 

 

 

Remarks 8.4.8. 1. Our results in fact show that if an element in G(k), for a
group G of type Go, is conjugate to its inverse in G(k), the conjugating element can
be chosen to be an involution. The same is true for unipotents (these are always
conjugate to their inverses).

2. The obstruction : From our results, we see that semisimple elements be-
longing to decomposable tori are always product of two involutions and hence real in
G(k). For semisimple elements belonging to an indecomposable maximal torus T, the
obstruction to reality is measured by L'/N(E!), where T C SU(V,6) = SU(E,5™)
is given by T = €1 and € is a cubic field extension of L. In the other case, when
T C SL(8), the obstruction is measured by k*/N(F*), where F is a cubic field ex-
tension of k. In both cases, the obstruction has a Brauer group interpretation. When
T Cc SL(3) C G is an indecomposable maximal torus, coming from a cyclic cubic
field extension F of k, the obstruction to reality for elements in T(k), is the relative
Brauer group B(F/k). For an indecomposable torus T C SU(E,h"“) C G, where € is
a cubic cyclic field extension of L, the obstruction is the quotient B(E/L)/¢(B(F/k),
where F is the subfield of €, fixed by the involution o on € and ¢ is the base change
map B(F/k) — B(E/L).

8.5. Centralizers in Anisotropic G2

In this section, we compute conjugacy classes of centralizers in compact G2. Let
G be an anisotropic group of type G2 over a field k. Then there exists €, an octonion
division algebra over k, such that G = Aut(€). By abuse of notation we write
G = Aut(€). We fix these notation for this section. First, we calculate centralizer of
an element in G. Let t € G. We denote the centralizer of t in G by Z(t) = {g €

G | gt = tg}. Since G is anisotropic, every element in G is semisimple and leaves a
