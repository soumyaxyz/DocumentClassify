8.2. SU(V,5) CG 69

N(g) = x, 9o0(g) = 1. Hence x € Ly. Conversely, if N(x) € Ly for some x € E* such
that vo(a) = 1 then N(x) € ker(¢).

 

 

 

 

Hence if the field k is C; (for example, finite field) or it does not admit degree three
extensions (real closed fields, algebraically closed fields etc.), L*/N(£*) is trivial.
From Corollary 8.2.11, it follows that every element in G(€/L), with irreducible
characteristic polynomial, is conjugate to its inverse. In particular, combining with
Theorem 8.1.9, it follows that every semisimple element in G(k) is conjugate to its

inverse.

Proposition 8.2.14. With notation as above, let L be a quadratic field extension
of k and let S € SU(H) be an element with irreducible characteristic polynomial over
L, satisfying S = S-'. Let € = L[X]/ys(X), a degree three field extension of L,
and assume L'/N(E1) is nontrivial, where L' = {x € L | xo(x) = 1}, €1 = {re
E | xo(x) = 1} and o is the extension of the nontrivial automorphism of L to E.
Then there exists an element A € SU(H) with characteristic polynomial same as the
characteristic polynomial of S, which can not be written as A = A, Ay where A; = Aj!
and A; € SU(H). The corresponding element t in G(€/L) is not a product of two

involutions in G = Aut(€) and hence not real in G.

Proof. Let b € L1 such that b? ¢ N(E'). Put D = diag(b, 1,1) and A= DSD“!,
then A belongs to SU(H). Now suppose A = A; A with A; = Aj! and A; € SU(H).
Then A = AA, = DSD-! = DSDD~?. Put T; = DSD and Ty = D~?, then
T; =T;'. Since A,AAZ! = A7! and T,ATy! = AM, we have Ty'Ay € Zyv4)(A),
ie., Ty Ay = f(A) for some f(X) € L[X] (see the Remark after Corollary 8.2.11).
Then b? = det(Ty') = det(Ty As) = det(f(A)) € N(E*), a contradiction.

 

 

 

 

Remark 8.2.15. If we choose S' in the theorem above with characteristic polyno-
mial separable, then the element A, constructed in the proof, is a semisimple element

in an indecomposable maximal torus, contained in SU(H), which is not real.

We recall that any central division algebra of degree three is cyclic ({P], Theorem,
Section 15.6). Let L be a quadratic field extension of k. Let F' be a degree three
cyclic extension of k and we denote EF = F.L. Let us denote the generator of the
Galois group of F over k by rt. Let A = F © Fu @ Fu? with udu“! = r(d) for
alld € F and u? = a € k*. Then A, denoted by (F,7,a), is a cyclic algebra of
degree three over k. Recall also that (F,7,a) is a division algebra if and only if
a € Nrje(F*). We denote the relative Brauer group of F over k by B(F/k), i.e.,
