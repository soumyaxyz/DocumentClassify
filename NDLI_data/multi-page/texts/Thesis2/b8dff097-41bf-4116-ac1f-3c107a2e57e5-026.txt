14 2. LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

The next proposition reduces the study of structure of reductive groups to that

of tori and semisimple groups ({Sp], Corollary 8.1.6).

Proposition 2.3.1. Let G be a connected reductive group. Let G’ = |G, G] be the
commutator subgroup of G. Then, G = G'.Z° where Z° is the connected component
of the center of G.

In this decomposition G’ is a semisimple group and Z° is a torus. Moreover, this
decomposition is an almost direct product, i-e., the intersection of G’ and Z° is a
finite group (or equivalently the connected component of this intersection is triv-
ial). An example of this decomposition is GL,(k) = SLn(k).Z2(GL,»(k))° where
Z(GL,(k)) = 2(GL,(k))° = k*. The intersection of the components is scalar matri-
ces AI of determinant 1, i.e., A” = 1, which is a finite group.

Let G be a connected semisimple group. We can decompose such a group as an
almost direct product of simple groups. Recall that a group G is a simple (also called
quasi-simple) algebraic group if any proper normal subgroup of G is finite and lies
in the center of G. Some examples of simple groups are SLn, SOn, Spon, G2 (all these

groups have been introduced in this thesis) et cetra. We have ({Sp], Theorem 8.1.5),

Proposition 2.3.2. Let G be a connected semisimple group. Then G has a finite

set of closed normal subgroups G1,...,G_ such that:
(i) each G; is simple,
(ii) [GG] =1 fi Fj,
(iii) G = G1G2:--Gy,
(iv) GiN Gy -++Gi-1Giy1-++G, is finite for each i.

The G; are uniquely determined by these conditions. They are called simple com-
ponents of the semisimple group G. Simple groups can be classified via root system

which we recall briefly in next section.

2.4. Root Datum and Reductive Groups

Let G be a connected reductive group over k. Let g be the Lie algebra of G.
Then G acts via the Ad representation on the Lie algebra g, i.e., we have a rational
representation Ad: G — GL(g). We fix a maximal torus T in G and denote the
character group of T by X(T’) = Hom(T,G,,,). If the rank of the group G is r then
the group X is isomorphic to Z”. The torus T acts on g via the Ad representation.

Since T is a commuting set of semisimple elements, it acts diagonally on g ({Sp],
