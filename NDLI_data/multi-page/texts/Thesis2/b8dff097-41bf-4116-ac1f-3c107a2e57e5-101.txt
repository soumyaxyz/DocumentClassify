9.2. COHOMOLOGICAL OBSTRUCTION TO REALITY 89

Proof. Let g be real in G, i.e., there exists  € G such that rgv~! = g-!. Then

1

x conjugates g, and g, to gz! and g7! respectively.

Conversely let h € H such that hgy'h7! = 2g,v7!. Then,
holeg(h te)! = holaga th =holagalegqye th =h-'grlagya th

= goth 'xqa'th= 9.'g,' =9"".

 

 

Hence g is real in G.

 

 

It is not true that g is real if and only if g, real and g, real. We give examples of
this situation.
Example 1: Let G = GL4(k). We take s = diag(A, A, 71, A7!) with \? 4 1, u =

diag (( ; : and g = su. Then g, = S$, g, = u and the centralizer of

sin G is Zgr,(n)(s) = {diag(A, B) | A, B € GL2(k)}. The elements s and wu are real
but g is not real. In fact asa7! = s~! where

The elements w

Example 2: In G2 over a finite field, all semisimple as well as unipotent elements

are real but still there are nonreal elements (see Section 8.4.3).

Next we derive a cohomological obstruction to reality over the base field k. Let G
be a connected linear algebraic group defined over k. Let t € G(k) be real in G. We
put H = Z(t), the centralizer of t in G. Let X = {x € G| xta-! = t-1}. Then X is
an H-torsor defined over k with H-action given by h.c = xh forh € H and xe X.

Since t is real over k, we have X 4 ¢. The torsor X corresponds to an element
of H'(k, H) ([Se], Chapter 1, section 5.2, Proposition 33). Let « € X and 7 be the
cocycle corresponding to X. Then 7¥ is given by 7(0) = a~1o(z) for allo € T =

Gal(k/k). Now we look for a condition which determines when t is k-real.

Proposition 9.2.2. Let G be a connected algebraic group defined over k. Let
t € G(k) be real over k. Then t is real in G(k) if and only y, as above, represents a

trivial cocycle in H1(k, H) where H is the centralizer of t in G.
