Benefits of USING ANALYTICAL INFORMATION FOR
DECISION SUPPORT

This type of decision making will lead to business benefits.

It will provide insight into the operational efficiencies;

It will help explore untapped opportunities; and above all it will serve as a
window to the business dynamics and performance.

It will help provide answers to questions, like

“Who are my most profitable customers?”

“Which are our most profitable products?”

“Which is the most profitable marketing channel?”

“What are the various up-sell and cross-sell opportunities?”
“Who are my best performing employees?”

“How is my company performing in terms of the customer
expectations?”, etc.

It’s is true that business executives, operations staff, and planning analysts
all made decisions even when “Business Intelligence” or Business Analytics
were not there. The evolution of BI made decision making faster, reliable,
consistent, and highly team oriented.
