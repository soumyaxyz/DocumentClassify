Features of Business Intelligence

Fact-based decision making:
Decisions made through Business Intelligence are based purely on fact and history.
It is about staying in tune with the data flowing through your business systems.

Refer to the case study brief on “GoodFood Restaurants Inc.”. Let us try to understand
fact-based decision making using the example of our “GoodFood” restaurant. Every
restaurant will report the quantity of food wasted across the globe within six hours from
the closing hour of restaurant. This data is aggregated and shared among all chefs, back
office staff, operations manager, and marketing campaign teams. A team analyzes reasons
and spot drivers of variance and set target to reduce wastage week-by-week. The same
team tracks data and initiates actions to correct the process to reduce waste and achieve set
target.

Single version of truth: Put simply, a single version of truth means that if the same piece of
data is available at more than one place, all the copies of the data should agree wholly and
in every respect. BI helps provide single version of truth.

In our above example of the restaurant, picture a customer walking into the restaurant a
little late for lunch. He asks at the reception about the availability of a particular cuisine
(say, Thai cuisine) at the buffet lunch. The receptionist confirms the availability after
checking on the networked computer system, and the customer proceeds to the dining
area. On the way, the customer come across the head waiter and asks the same question.
He too confirmed using his PDA (Personal Digital Assistant).

Thus, this is the “single version of truth” wherein same piece of information shared by
multiple persons agrees wholly and in every respect.
