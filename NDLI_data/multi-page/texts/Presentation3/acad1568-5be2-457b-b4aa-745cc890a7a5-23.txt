Data Mining in Credit Card Fraud

Credit card fraud costs the industry billions of dollars each year and pattern
discovery tools and machine learning models such as neural networks are routinely

used to analyze fraud databases to identify triggers.

“A self-service transaction at a gas station followed by an expensive purchase” is
indicative of fraud.
— An example pattern learned from credit card fraud data
— Pattern is then used in real-time to flag transactions that might be fraudulent.
For instance, if you fill gas in your car with a credit card and then make an
expensive purchase then the merchant may be instructed (by the point of sale

system) to check the user’s ID.
