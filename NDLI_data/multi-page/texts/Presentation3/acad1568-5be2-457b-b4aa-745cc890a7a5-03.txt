USING ANALYTICAL INFORMATION FOR DECISION
SUPPORT

In the past, leading market research firms noticed that often senior
executives in businesses leveraged “numerical information” to support their
decisions.

They started using the term “Business Intelligence’’(BI) for the set of
concepts and processes that allows a business executive to make informed
decisions.

The IT applications providing such “numerical information” were
commonly called "analytical applications” to distinguish them from
transaction-oriented applications.

The decision making became informed decision making with the use of BI.
What is an “informed decision’?

— Itis a decision based on fact and fact alone.
— Why is it required to make informed decisions?

* The simple reason is informed decisions based on fact, not on gut feeling, more often than not are the correct
decisions. It’s easy to communicate “facts” to the large number of stakeholders.

— Consistency in decision making

* A large dispersed set of decision makers ¢an arriveat the same conclusion when facts are presented and
interpreted the same way.
