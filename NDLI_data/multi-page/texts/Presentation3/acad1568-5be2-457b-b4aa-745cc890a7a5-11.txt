Features of Business Intelligence (Contd..)

360 degree perspective on your business: BI allows looking at the business from
various perspectives. Each person in the project/program team will look at the
data from his/her role and will look for attributes that add value for decision
making in his/her role.

In the GoodFood example, a “reservation table number” helps the steward
escort guests to the right place in the dining area, helps the chef visit the guests to
describe the “day's speciality”, and helps the service staff reach for cleaning and
rearrange table whenever needed. Similarly, the food wastage will be viewed by
different department with different perspectives — the finance by cost of wastage,
the housekeeping by disposal methods, chefs by reason for rejection by guests,
the quality team for finding innovative approaches to reduction, and the
information systems team for devising measures that indicate improvement in
processes.

Virtual team members on the same page: In today’s business context, not all
stakeholders or decision makers will be in the same building/geographic location.
Businesses are highly distributed in nature and executives travel extensively. The
team of people who work on a common project/purpose/business goal but are
spread across locations is terms as a virtual team. Technologies like BI bring them
peetticr and provide them the same facts at the speed of light in personalized

orms.
