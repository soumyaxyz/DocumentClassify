BI Benefit - Visibility into Enterprise Performance

Business Intelligence provides a clear insight into the enterprise's
performance.

This is by way of an operational dashboard.

An operational dashboard makes use of visual forms such as charts, tables,
matrix, indicators, etc.

In our example of the GoodFood Restaurant, the restaurant owner views the
progress of the chain of restaurants on a single dashboard. This quickly tells
him, with relevant data, which branch is doing excellent business, where the
business is average with data, etc. Timely information as provided by the
dashboard leads to early remedial procedures.
