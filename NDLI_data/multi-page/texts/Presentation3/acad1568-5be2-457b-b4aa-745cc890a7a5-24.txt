Data Mining in UI Optimization

“A simple example had to do with discovering that on the Yahoo Front Page,
centering the search box on the page (as opposed to having it be left-justified) would
increase consumer usage. This led to better user engagement and there was no cost
to Yahoo! to make the change. This was discovered by discovering the hidden
pattern that showed that Netscape users tended to use search more than IE users, and
by discovering that the only visible difference was the subtle position of the box! It
was centered on Netscape browsers but left justified on IE browsers. A very
unnoticeable difference, yet an important one. Who would figure that out???”
