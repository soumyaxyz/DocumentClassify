than in hardwoods, educational efforts are
developing a wider appreciation of the out-
standing opportunities for managing industrial
hardwoods on suitable sites. The recent in-
crease in demand for pulping hardwoods may
stimulate management too.

Mississippi’s forest soils have the capacity
to produce a much greater volume of wood
than they are currently growing. It can be
reasonably assumed that, with application of
minimum forestry practices on all commercial
timberlands, net annual growth might be raised
eventually from 0.5 cord per acre to nearly
1 cord. This would permit the State to enjoy
an even greater forest industry than it now
does. A still higher average growth can prob-
ably be attained under intensive management.
The prescription for continued forward move-
ment includes minimizing wildfire, restocking
idle land, and removing trees that have little
or no utility. Given good timber resources,
wood-using industry will thrive, and the two
will perpetuate each other.

ACCURACY OF THE SURVEY

The data on forest acreage and timber volume
in this report were secured in 1956-57 with a
systematic sampling method involving a forest-
nonforest classification on aerial photographs
and on-the-ground measurements of trees at
sample points. The sample points were taken
in pairs at and near the intersections of a grid
of lines spaced 3 miles apart. Tally trees were
selected with a 3.03 diopter prism.

Accuracy of the estimates may be affected
by two types of errors. The first stems from
the use of a sample to estimate the whole and
from variability of the items being sampled.
This type is termed sampling error; it is sus-
ceptible to a mathematical evaluation of the
probability of error. The second type—often
referred to as reporting or estimating error—
derives from mistakes in measurement, judg-
ment, arithmetic, or recording, and limitations
of method or equipment. Effects cannot be
appraised mathematically, but the Forest Sur-
vey constantly attempts to hold such error
to a minimum by proper training and good
supervision, and by emphasis on careful work.

Statistical analysis of the data indicates a
sampling error of plus or minus 0.3 percent for
the estimate of total forest area, 1.4 percent

for total cubic volume, and 1.9 percent for
total board-foot volume. When acreage and
volume totals for the State are broken down
by county and other subdivisions of the data,
the possibility of error increases and is greatest
for the smallest items. The order of this in-
crease is suggested in the following tabulation,
which shows the sampling error to which the
estimates are liable two chances out of three.

County data on timber volumes have been
included in the report in order to permit adding
counties totalling enough volume to meet a
desired degree of reliability. To obtain an esti-
mate of growing stock with a sampling error
of plus or minus 10 percent, data for enough
counties must be added together to total about
150 million cubic feet. A comparable sampling
error for sawtimber volume requires about
1,000 million board feet.

DEFINITIONS OF TERMS
Forest Land Class

Forest land.—Includes: (a) land which is
at least 10 percent stocked by trees of any size
and capable of producing timber or other wood
products, or of exerting an influence on the
climate or on the water regime; (b) land from
which the trees have been removed to less
than 10 percent stocking and which has not
been developed for other use; (c) afforested
areas.

Commercial forest land.—Forest land which
is (a) producing, or is physically capable of
producing, usable crops of wood (usually saw-
timber), (b) economically available now or
prospectively, and (c) not withdrawn from
timber utilization.
