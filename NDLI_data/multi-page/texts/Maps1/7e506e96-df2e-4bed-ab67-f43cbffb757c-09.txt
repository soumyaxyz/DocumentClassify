Mississippi Forests: An Industrial Resource

In the search for resources to support indus-
trial expansion in Mississippi, it is logical to
turn to the forests. The area occupied by
forests in Mississippi exceeds the combined
acreage in all other land uses. Each year tre-
mendous quantities of pine and hardwood are
taken from these forests and made into a wide
variety of products.

This report provides information to assist
managers of wood-using industries and con-
sulting foresters in appraising locations and
categories of standing timber that may offer
possibilities for development. It is based main-
ly upon data gathered during the most recent
Forest Survey of Mississippi, which was com-
pleted in 1957 by the Southern Forest Experi-
ment Station. It also draws upon the previous
survey of 1948 in order to show the changes
that have been occurring. The information is
largely in the form of generalized maps that
describe various aspects of the forest situation,
such as the geographic distribution of timber
volume, woodland area, and output of timber
products.

TIMBER RESOURCES

Forests predominantly of longleaf and slash
pine characterize the lower Coastal Plain and
comprise 2 million of Mississippi’s 17.2 million
woodland acres. Extending north from the
coastal region, loblolly and shortleaf pine cover
4.6 million acres. Another 2.7 million acres of
uplands are occupied by oak, hickory, and other
hardwoods in mixture with various pines. In
the Delta and along rivers and streams through-
out the State are stands of bottom-land hard-
woods that aggregate 3.8 million acres. Upland
hardwood forests, largely concentrated in a
zone bordering the eastern edge of the Mis-
sissippi River alluvial plain, total 4.1 million
acres.

As is shown in table 1, pine makes up 51
percent of the sawtimber inventory in Mis-
sissippi forests. Other softwoods—cypress and
redcedar—total scarcely 2 percent. Of the
hardwood volume, oaks account for 36 percent,
gums 27 percent, hickories 9 percent; and the
remaining 28 percent consists of other hard-
woods, with yellow-poplar, elm, cottonwood,
magnolia, willow, ash, beech, sycamore, and
hackberry ranking in the order named.

In general, quality specifications are more
demanding for hardwood than for pine. Among
the several industrial uses of hardwoods, the
manufacture of standard factory lumber pre-
dominates. Suitability of logs for this purpose,
therefore, may be taken as one measure of the
