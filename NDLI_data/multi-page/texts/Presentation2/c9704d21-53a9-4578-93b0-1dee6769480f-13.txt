Metadata management: Metadata is data about data.

Consider CD/DVD of music. There is the date of recording, the name of the artist, the genre of music, the
songs in the album, copyright information, etc. All this information constitutes the metadata for the CD/DVD
of music. In the context of a camera, the data is the photographic image. The metadata then is the date and
time when the was taken. In simple words, metadata is data about data. When used in the context of a data
warehouse, it is the data that defines the warehouse objects. Few examples of metadata are timestamp at
which the data was extracted, the data sources from where metadata has been extracted, and the missing
fields/columns that have been added by data cleaning or integration processes. Metadata management
involves tracking, assessment, and maintenance of metadata.
Metadata can be divided into four groups:

— Business metadata

— Process metadata

— Technical metadata

— Application metadata
