Business Layer- Business Value

When a strategy is implemented against certain business goals, then certain costs (monetary, time, effort,
information produced by data integration and analysis, application of knowledge from past experience,
etc.) are involved.

However, the final output of the process should create such value for the business whose ratio to the costs
involved should be a feasible ratio.

The business value can be measured in the terms of ROI (Return on Investment), ROA (Return on
Assets), TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), TVO(Total Value of Ownership), etc. Let us understand these
terms with the help of a few examples —

Return on Investment (ROI): We take the example of “Digicom”, a digital electrocompany which has
an online community platform that allows their prospective clients to engage with their users. “Digicom”
has been using social media (mainly Twitter and Facebook) to help get new clients and to increase the
number of prospects/leads. They attribute 10% of their daily revenue to social media. Now, that is an ROI
from social media!
Return on Asset (ROA): Suppose a company, “Electronics Today”, has a net income of $1 million and
has total assets of $5 million. Then, its ROA is 20%. So, ROA is the earning from invested capital
(assets).
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Let us understand TCO in the context of a vehicle. TCO defines the
cost of owning a vehicle from the time of purchase by the owner, through its operation and maintenance
to the time it leaves the possession of the owner.
Total Value of Ownership (TVO): TVO has replaced the simple concept of Owner's Equity in some
companies. It could include a variety of subcategories such as stock, undistributed dividends, retained
earnings or profit, or excess capital contributed.
In its simplest form, the basic accounting equation containing TVO as a component is

Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, or if you like TVO
