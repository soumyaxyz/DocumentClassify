Warehousing

It is the process which prepares the basic repository of data (called
data warehouse) that becomes the data source where we extract
information from.

Date Warehouse: A data warehouse is a data store. It is structured
on the dimensional model schema, which is optimized for data
retrieval rather than update.

Data warehousing must play the following five distinct roles:
— Intake
— Integration
— Distribution
— Delivery
— Access
