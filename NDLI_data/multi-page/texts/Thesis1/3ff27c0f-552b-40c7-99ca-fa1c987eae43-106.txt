Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 94

 

In the notation of Corollary 3.2.25 , we have Ago = Span{t); :1 = 0,1/2, ...... Le
A® in this case. All the conditions of Theorem 3.2.22 and Corollary 3.2.25 are satisfied.
Thus, the universal object of the category C exists ( notation as in Corollary 3.2.25 )
and we denote it by 0.

Before proving the next result, we note the following fact. We recall the fundamental
a —py

unitary of SU,,(2) given by (
y a*

) which is the matrix corresponding to the

ai
coproduct A on span {a. — py*} as given in subsection 1.2.4. This implies that Va=

NI

1
span {a,7*} and V? = span {a*,7}.

Lemma 3.4.1. Given a CQG Q with a C* action ® on A, the following are equivalent

1.(Q,®) is an element of Obj(C).

2. The action is linear, in the sense that ee ( equivalently Vip ) ts invariant
under ® and the representation obtained by restricting ® to Vie is a unitary represen-
tation.

3. ® is linear and Haar state preserving.

4. ® keeps vi invariant for each fixed | and i.

Proof : 1. = 2. Since ® commutes with D, ® keeps each of the eigenspaces of
D invariant and so in particular preserves vy , that is ® is linear. The condition

(h @ id)® = h(-).1 implies the unitarity of the corresponding representation.

2 => 3. By linearity, write O(a) =a@X+7* @Y and Oy") =a@Z+y7*@W.

Firstly, ®-invariance of Span{t} ys fork =O and k= $ follow from the linearity and
the fact that ®(1) = 1.

Next, we show that ® keeps Span{t}; :t,j =—1,0, 1} invariant.

We recall the explicit form of the matrix ( (ti,)) from [43]:

a WP + 1a*y — py?

yrat* 1-(w+l)y*y ay

—py? (w+ 1jyta oe?
By inspection, we see that ®(V;!) C V @ Q for i= —1,1.
Hence, it is enough to check the ®-invariance for ay and 1 — (u? + 1)y*7.
We have

 

®(a7)
= (A®@X4+7 @Y/)(a* ®Z*+78W*)
= al @xXZ*+77@YW* +ay@XxXw*+77a* @YZ*
