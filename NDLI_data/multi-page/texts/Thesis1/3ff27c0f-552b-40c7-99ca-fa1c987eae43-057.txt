If the generator of i-th copy of Z5 is denoted by 1;, then the action of 1; is given by
Li (21, 22, 005 Zn) = (215 ey Z—15 May Zit1; +) Zn) Where (21, 22,.--,2n) € T”. Lastly, the ac-

tion of T” on itself is its usual action.

1.4.3. Spin Groups and Spin manifolds

We begin with Clifford algebras. Let @ be a quadratic form on an n dimensional vector
space V. Then Cl(V,Q) will denote the universal associative algebra C equipped with
a linear map i : V — C, such that i(V) generates C as a unital algebra satisfying
(Vy? =Q(V).1

Let 6 : V — ClV,Q) be defined by B(x) = —i(x). Then, Cl(V,Q) =
Cl°(V,Q) & CU(V,Q) where Cl°(V,Q) = {a € CIV, Q) : B(x) = x}, CU(V,Q) =
{x € CLV, Q) : B(x) = -a}.

We will denote by Cy, and C& the Clifford algebras Cl(R”,—aj — ... — #2) and
CUC", 22 +... + 22) respectively.

We will denote the vector space cll by the symbol A,,. It follows that ce =
End(A,,) if n is even and equals End(A,,) @ End(A,,) is n is odd. There is a represen-

tation C° — End(A,,) which is the isomorphism with End(A,,) when n is even and in

 

the odd case, it is the isomorphism with End(A,,)6End(A,,) followed by the projection
onto the first component. This representation restricts to Cn, to be denoted by ky, and
called the spin representation. This representation is irreducible when n is odd and for
n even, it decomposes into two irreducible representations which decomposes A,, into a
direct sum of two vector spaces A and A>.

Pin(n) is defined to be the subgroup of C,, generated by elements of the form {zx :
|| || = 1,2 € R"}. Spin (n) is the group given by Pin(n)/N C®. There exists a continuous
group homomorphism from Pin(n) to O(n) which restricts to a two covering map 2 :

Spin(n) — SO(n).

Let M be an n-dimensional orientable Riemannian manifold. Then we have the
oriented orthonormal bundle of frames over M ( which is a principal SO(n) bundle )
which we will denote by F.

Such a manifold M is said to be a spin manifold if there exists a pair (P, A) (
called a spin structure ) where

(1) P is a Spin( n ) principal bundle over M.

(2) Ais a map from P to F such that it is a 2-covering as well as a bundle map
over M.

(3) A(p.g) = A(p).g where A(g) = g.

Given such a spin structure, we consider the associated bundle $ = P Xgpin(n) An

called the ‘ bundle of spinors ’.
