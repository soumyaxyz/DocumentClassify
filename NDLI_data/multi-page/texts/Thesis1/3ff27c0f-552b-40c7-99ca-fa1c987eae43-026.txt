from which it follows that (id ® w;)(Y) — (id @w)(Y) in the strong operator topology.

 

 

 

Let A and B be two unital *-algebras. Then a linear map T from A to B is callec
n-positive if T @ Id, : A® M,(C) — B® M,(C) is positive for all k < n but no
necessarily for k = n+ 1. T is said to be completely positive ( CP for short ) if it is

 

n-positive for all n. It is a well known result that fora CP map T : A > B(H), one has

the following operator inequality for all a in A:
T(a)*T(a) < ||T(1)|| T(a*a). (1.1.1)

Tensor product and composition of two CP maps are CP. The following is an useful

result about CP maps.

Proposition 1.1.9. [f A and B are C* algebras with A commutative, is a positive
map from A to B, then ¢ is CP. The same holds if is from B to A.

1.1.4 Hilbert modules

Given a *-subalgebra A C B(H) ( where H is a Hilbert space ), a semi-Hilbert A module
E is a right A-module equipped with a sesquilinear map (., .) : E x E > A satisfying
(x,y)* = (y,x), (a,ya) = (a,y)a and (z,x) > 0 for x,y in E and a in A. A semi
Hilbert module is called a pre-Hilbert module if (z,x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. It is
called a Hilbert module if furthermore, A is a C* algebra and EF is complete in the norm

* norm of A.

The simplest examples of Hilbert A modules are the so called trivial A modules of
the form H @ A where H is a Hilbert space with an A valued sesquilinear form defined
on H @aig A by : (€ Ba, € Ba’) = (E, €') a*a’. The completion of H @aig A with respect
to this pre Hilbert module structure is a Hilbert A module and is denoted by H @ A.
We recall that for a pre Hilbert A module E ( A is a C* algebra ), the Cauchy

Schwarz inequality holds in the following form: 0 < (x,y) (y,x) < (#, x) ||(y,y)|| -
