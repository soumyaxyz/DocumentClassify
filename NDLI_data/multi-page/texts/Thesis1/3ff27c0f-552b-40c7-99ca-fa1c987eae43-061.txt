Now, we define D= ° act ) :

Then, (Aj°,H, D) is a spectral triple of compact type. In particular, for 6 = 0, this

coincides with the classical spectral triple on C(T?).

1.5.2 The space of forms in noncommutative geometry

We start this subsection by recalling the universal space of one forms corresponding to

an algebra.

Proposition 1.5.7. Given an algebra B, there is a ( unique upto isomorphism ) B—B
bimodule 01(B) and a derivation 5 : B + 01(B) ( that is, 5(ab) = 6(a)b + a6(b) for all
a,b in B ), satisfying the following properties:

(i) O1(B) is spanned as a vector space by elements of the form ad(b) with a,b be-
longing to B; and

(ii) for any B—B bimodule E and a derivation d: B > E, there is an unique B—B
linear map n : Q!(B) — E such that d= 0 6.

The bimodule !(B) is called the space of universal 1-forms an B and 6 is called the
universal derivation.

We can also introduce universal space of higher forms on B, 0*(B), say, for k =
2,3,..., by defining them recursively as follows: Q*+!(B) = 0*(B) @g 01(B) and also set
0°(B) = B.

Now we briefly discuss the notion of the noncommutative Hilbert space of forms
which will need noncommutative volume form for a spectral triple of compact type. We

refer to [29] ( page 124 -127 ) and the references therein for more details.

Definition 1.5.8. A spectral triple (A°,H,D) of compact type is said to be O-
summable if e'D” is of trace class for allt > 0. A O-summable spectral triple is called
finitely summable when there is some p > 0 such that t? Tr(e-!P”) is bounded on (0, 6]
for some 6 > 0. The infimum of all such p, say p' is called the dimension of the spectral

triple and the spectral triple is called p'-summable.

Remark 1.5.9. We remark that the definition of O-summability to be used in this thesis
is stronger than the one in [17] ( page 390, definition 1. ) in which a spectral triple is
called ©-summable if Tr(e~P”) < oo.

For a O-summable spectral triple, let ¢)(T) = for A > 0. We note that

A+ 0)(T) is bounded.
