Corollary 4.3.4. (9;, U;) is an orientation preserving isometric action on the spectral
triple (AZ, H, D).

We shall now show that if we fix a ‘volume-form’ in terms of an R-twisted structure,

then the ‘deformed’ action a,j preserves it.

Lemma 4.3.5. Suppose, in addition to the set-up already assumed, that there is an
invertible positive operator R on H such that (A~,H, D, R) is an R-twisted O-summable
spectral triple, and let Tr be the corresponding ‘volume form’. Assume that ay preserves

the functional Tr. Then the action ay, preserves TR too.

Proof : Let the (finite dimensional) eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue A, of
D be Vn. As U commutes with D, there exists subspaces V,, , of Vn and an orthonormal
basis {er}, for V;,,x such that the restriction of U to V;x is irreducible. Write U (en @
Hv=>s); a @ tj. Then, o*(e9"*) =e’ kg Ue

Then H will be decomposed as H = ®n>1, ¢Vn,k-

Let R( en) = Ls Fri, j,s, ter?

By hypothesis, me @id)U* preserves the functional rr(-) = T'r(R -) on Ep where Ep
is as in Proposition 3.2.7, that is the weakly dense * subalgebra of B(H) generated by
the rank one operators |€ >< n| where €,77 are eigenvectors of D. Thus, (tp @id)(O(X @
id)U*) = tp(X).1q for all X in Ep.

Then, for a in Ep, we have:

(tr ® h)(Uz(a ® 1)U3)
-> (eq @1,0;(a@ 1)05(Re* @ 1))
