Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 88

 

Definition 3.2.24. Let A be a C* algebra and A® be a dense *-subalgebra. Let
(A®,H, D) be a spectral triple of compact type as above.

Let G be the category with objects (Q,a) such that Q is a compact quantum group
with a C* action a on A such that:

1. a is T preserving ( where T is as above ), that is, (r ® id)(a(a)) = 7(a).1.

2. a maps Ago inside Apo @aig Q.

3. aD= (D @l)a.

Corollary 3.2.25. There exists a universal object 8 of the category € and it is iso-
morphic to the Woronowicz C* subalgebra G = QISO*(D) of G obtained in Theorem

Proof : The proof of the existence of the universal object follows verbatim from the
proof of Theorem 2.1.5 replacing £ by D and noting that D has compact resolvent. We
denote by @ the action of oO on A.

Now, we prove that Cis isomorphic to G.

Each eigenvector of D is in A® by assumption. It is easily observed from the proof
of Theorem 3.2.22 that ay, maps the norm-dense *-subalgebra Ago into Ao @alg Go,
and (id®€)oay, = id, so that ay, is indeed a C* action of the CQG G. Moreover, it can
be easily seen that 7 preserves ay, and that ay, commutes with D. Therefore, (G, ayy)
is an element of Obj(C) and hence G is a quantum subgroup of 8 by the universality
of O.

For the converse, we start by showing that @ induces a unitary representation W of
8 * C(T) on H which commutes with D, and the corresponding conjugated action ay
coincides with @.

Define W(a€) = @(a)(€)(1 ® q*) for all a in A§° where q is a generator of C(T).

Since we have (7 @ id)(a(a)) = 7(a).1, it follows that W isa (Q « C(T)-linear)
isometry on the dense subspace Ago€ @alg Q and thus extends to H ® ) * C(T)) as an
isometry. Moreover, since @(A) (1 Q) is norm dense in A @ Q (by the definition of a
CQG action) it is clear that the range of W is dense, so W is indeed a unitary. It is
quite obvious that it is a unitary representation of Ox C(T).

We also have,

W D(aé)
= W(D(a)é) = a(D(a))(6)(1@ 4")
= (D@N(A(ag)(1@ q*) = (D®NWak),

that is, W commutes with D.
Moreover, it is easy to observe that aw = @. This gives a surjective CQG morphism
from G =G * C(T) to Ox C(T), sending G onto 6, which completes the proof.
