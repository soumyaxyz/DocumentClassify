Chapter 1: Preliminaries 36

 

If the Frechet algebra has an involution * which is continuous and if a acts by *

automorphisms, then * is also an involution for the deformed product xj.

Proposition 1.3.3. ( Lemma 2.20, [46] ) Let f,g belongs to BA and let g have the

lattice L as a period lattice so that g can be viewed as a smooth function on the compact

group H =V/L. Then f f f(u)g(v)e(u.v)dudv = Yo, f(p)(Sy, g(v)e(p.v)dv). A similar

statement holds if instead it is f which is periodic.

Now, we will define the C* algebra constructed by Rieffel corresponding to the data
(A, V, a, J) where A is also assumed to be a O* algebra and a a C* automorphism.

Let S4 be the space of A valued smooth functions on V such that the product of
their derivatives with any complex valued polynomials on V are bounded under the
supremum norm of S4, Then S“ is a pre Hilbert right A module with A valued inner

product defined by

f, Da= [ f(v)*g(v)dv,

for f,g belonging to S4.
Then, for a in A, one defines the operator Lz on S4 by

Fat fy(o)= ff essa) fle + v)e(uv)dude,

where f belongs to 4. Then

Proposition 1.3.5. ( Theorem 4.6 of [46] ) La is a bounded operator having an adjoint
on the pre Hilbert module SA and at Lz is a* representation of the algebra (A®, x7)
into the C* algebra of bounded operators on SA.
