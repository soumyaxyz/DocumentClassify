87 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

Taking the S-valued inner product (-,:)s on both sides of the above expression, and

using the fact that U preserves this S-valued inner product, we obtain

(ij » G7) 1

This implies,

Thus,

(Qa) 551 = of (Qdan(o,)
kk’

Hence, we have Q; = v/Qiti (where vj = ((vf?))). Thus, Q7‘v/Q; must be the (both-
sided) inverse of 0j. Thus, we get a canonical surjective morphism from A,, 4,(Q;) to the
C* algebra generated by {of : j,k =1,2,...d;}. This induces a surjective morphism
from the free product of Ay¢,(Qi), i = 1,2,... onto S. The rest of the arguments for
showing the existence of Gg will be quite similar to the arguments used in the proof of
Theorem 3.2.13, hence omitted.

Now we come to the proof of the last part of the theorem. For a in A®, U(aé@ lj=
ay (aU (E ® 1) = ay(a)(€ @ q). Now, recalling that Span{agé : a € A™} is dense in H,
it is clear that G =G* C*(q) &G*C(T).

 

 

 

 

Remark 3.2.23. Some of the ecamples considered in section 3.4 will show that the con-
—— +
ditions of the above theorem are not actually necessary; QISO (D) may exist without

the existence of a single cyclic separating eigenvector as above.

Let (A®,H,D) be a spectral triple of compact type satisfying the conditions of
the above theorem. Let the faithful vector state corresponding to the cyclic separating
vector € be denoted by r. Let Apo = span{a € A® : a€ is an eigenvector of D}.

Moreover, assume that Ago is norm dense in A®.

Let D : Ago Apo be defined by :

D(a)é = D(a8).

This is well defined since € is cyclic and separating.
