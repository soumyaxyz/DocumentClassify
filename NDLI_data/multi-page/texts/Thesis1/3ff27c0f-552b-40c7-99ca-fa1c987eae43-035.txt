23 Quantum Groups

 

3.1 of [59], we have that the inductive limit Sp of S, s has a unique CQG structure with
the following property: for any CQG S’ and any family of CQG morphisms ¢y : Sp > S’
such that @m7mn = ¢n, the uniquely defined morphism limn¢, in the category of unital
C* algebras is a morphism in the category of CQG s.

Combining the above two results, it follows that the free product C* algebra of an
arbitrary sequence of CQG s has a natural CQG structure.

Moreover, the following result was derived in [59].

Proposition 1.2.24. Let [1,12 be a discrete abelian groups. Then the natural isomor-
phisms C*(T1) = C(Fi) and C*(11) * C*([2) = C*(L1 *TP2) are isomorphism of CQG

Ss.

Let 7; and ig be the inclusion of CQG s S; and S» into S; * Sg. If U; and U2
are unitary representations of CQG s S; and S_ on Hilbert spaces H, and Ha respec-
tively, then the free product representation of U; and U2 is a representation of
the CQG Sj; * Sz on the Hilbert space Hi © He given by the S; * Sp valued matrix

(id @ 11)U1 0
0 (id @ i2)Uq }

Similarly, the free product representation of an arbitrary sequence of CQG repre-

sentations are defined.

The inductive limit of an arbitrary sequence of CQG s has the structure of a CQG.
The following lemma is probably known, but we include the proof ( taken from [9] ) for

the sake of completeness.

Lemma 1.2.25. Suppose that (Sn)new ts a sequence of CQG s and for each n,m in
IN, n<m there is a CQG morphism Tm :Sn — Sm with the compatibility property

TmkOTnm =Trky MOMS k.

Then the inductive limit of C*-algebras (Sn)new has a canonical structure of a CQG.
It will be denoted Soo or limpnen Sn. It has the following universality property:

for any CQG (S,A) such that there are CQG morphisms Tt) : Sp — S satisfying for all
m,n € IN, m > n the equality Tm ° Tm = Tn, there exists a unique CQG morphism
Too 1 Soo 3 S such that Tr = Too © Tn oo for alln € IN, where we have denoted by Too

the canonical unital C*-homomorphism from Sp, into Soo-

Proof:
Let us denote the coproduct on S, by A;,. We consider the unital C*-homomorphism

Pn? Sn > Soo ® Soo given by pn = (Tn,co ® Tn,co) 0 An, and observe that these maps do
