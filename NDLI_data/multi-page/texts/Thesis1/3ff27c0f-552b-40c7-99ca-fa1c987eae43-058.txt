1.4.4 Dirac operators

We follow the notations of the previous subsection. On the space of smooth sections of

the bundle of spinors S, one can define an inner product by

(81, $2) g = I, (81 (x), $2(a)) dvol(x)

The Hilbert space obtained by completing the space of smooth sections with respect
to this inner product is denoted by L7($) and its members are called square integrable
spinors. The Levi Civita connection on M induces a canonical connection on S' which

we will denote by V°.

Definition 1.4.4. The Dirac operator on M is the self-adjoint extension of the fol-

lowing operator D defined on the space of smooth sections of S :
n
(Ds)(m) = > kn(Xi(m))(VS,5)(m),
i=l

where (X1,...Xn) are local orthonormal ( with respect to the Riemannian metric ) vector
fields defined in a neighborhood of m. In this definition, we have viewed X;(m) belonging
to Tm(M) as an element of the Clifford algebra Clc(ImM), hence kn(Xi(m)) is a map
on the fibre of S at m, which is isomorphic with A,. The self-adjoint extension of D is

again denoted by the same symbol.
We recall three important facts about the Dirac operator:

Proposition 1.4.5. (1) C®(M) acts on S by multiplication and this action extends
to a representation, say 7, of the C* algebra C(M) on the Hilbert space L?(S).
(2) For f inC®(M), [D,x(f)] has a bounded extension.

(3) Furthermore, the Dirac operator on a compact manifold has compact resolvents.

As the action of an element f in C°(M) on L?(S) is by multiplication operator, we
will use the symbol My; in place of 7(f).

The Dirac operator carries a lot of geometric and topological information. We give
two examples.

(a) The Riemannian metric of the manifold is recovered by

d(p,q) = SUP geCre(M), ||[D.Mg]|| <1 |o(P) — o(@)| - (1.4.1)

tD?

(b ) For a compact manifold, the operator e~”” is trace class for all t > 0. Then
