151 Quantum Isometry Groups of the Podles sphere

 

denote ay by ¢ from now on.

The computation has the following steps:

Step 1. We prove that ¢@ is ‘linear’, in the sense that it keeps the span of
{1, A, B, B*} invariant.

Step 2. We shall exploit the facts that ¢ is a x-homomorphism and preserves the
canonical volume form on SF ai that is the restriction of the Haar state of SU,,(2).

Step 3. We will compute the antipode of Q and apply it to get some more relations.

Step 4. We will use the above steps to identify Q as a subobject of SO,(3) which
will finish the proof.

Remark 5.3.1. The first step does not make use of the fact that a preserves the R-

twisted volume, so linearity of the action follows for any object in the bigger category

QD).

We now note down some useful facts for later use.

Lemma 5.3.2. We observe :
1. The eigenspace of D corresponding to (cil+c2) and —(cil +c) are span{v) at

2. The eigenspace of |D| corresponding to the eigenvalue (c1.3 +e) is span{a, y, a*,
yt.

Proof : 1. follows from ( 5.2.3 ). To prove 2., we note that by 1, it is sufficient to
