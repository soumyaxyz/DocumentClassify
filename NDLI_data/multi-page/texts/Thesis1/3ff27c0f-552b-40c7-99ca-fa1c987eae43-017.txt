Now we try to give an idea of the contents of each of the chapters. In chapter 1, we
discuss the concepts and results needed in the later chapters of the thesis. For the sake
of completeness, we begin with a glimpse of operator algebras and Hilbert modules, free
product and tensor products of C* algebras and some examples. The next section is
on quantum groups which we start with the basics of Hopf algebras and then define
compact quantum groups (CQG) and give relevant definitions and properties including
a brief review of Peter Weyl theory. After that, we introduce the quantum groups
U,.(2), SU (2), Au(Q) and U,,(su(2)). We end this section by introducing the notion of
a C* action of a compact quantum group on a C* algebra and giving an account of
Shuzhou Wang’s work in [60]. The next section is on Rieffel deformation where we
recall a part of the work done in [46] and [62] which are relevant to us. We describe
some important examples which are going to appear in chapter 4. The 4th section is
on classical Riemannian geometry which includes, among other things, the definition
and properties of Dirac operator which will serve as a motivation for the definition of ‘
spectral triple’ in the 5th section. This section also contains a subsection on isometry
groups of classical Riemannian manifold in which the characterizing property of an
isometry, in the form given in [30], is given. In the 5th section, we define spectral triples,
give examples of them, introduce the Hilbert space of forms (as in [29]), noncommutative
volume form and the notion of Laplacian in noncommutative geometry.

Chapter 2 is on the Laplacian-based approach to quantum isometry groups as pro-
posed in [30]. Here we recall the formulation of quantum isometry groups from [30] and
then compute them for the space of continuous functions on the classical 2-spheres, the
circle and the n-tori. In each of these cases, the quantum isometry group turns out to be
the same as the classical ones, that is, C(O(3)), C(S! ><iZ2) and C(T" ><(Z3 ><1S,,))
respectively ( S; being the permutation group on n symbols ).

Chapter 3 deals with the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries. The
classical situation is stated clearly, which will serve as a motivation for the quantum
formulation. Then, the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries of an R-
twisted spectral triple is defined ( see [31] for the definition of an R-twisted spectral
triple ) and its existence is proven. Given an R-twisted spectral triple (A~,H, D) of
compact type, we consider a category Q’ of pairs (Q,U) where Q is a compact quantum
group which has a unitary (co)-representation U on H commuting with D, and such
that for all state @ on Q, (id ® ¢)ady maps A® inside A%,. Moreover, let QR be a
subcategory of Q’ consisting of those (Q,U) for which ady preserves the R-twisted
volume form. In section 3.2, we have proved that Q’p has a_universal object to be
denoted by QISO}(D). The Woronowicz C* subalgebra of QI SOR(D) generated by
elements of the form (ady(a)(7 @ 1), 7’ @ 1)
