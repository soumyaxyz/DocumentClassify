127 Qi Ss OF of a Rieffel deformed noncommutative manifold

 

Replacing A by A_,7, we have

 

QISOf(A_y,H, D)
QISO}((A_s)s,H, D)_7 (in Q'p(A_s,H, D))

Ile

QISOR(A,H, D)_z (in Q'R(A-s,H,D)) = (QISOR(A,H, D))-.

 

 

Thus, QISO#(As,H,D) < (QISOR(A,H,D)); in Q’R(Az,H,D) which implies
QISOR(AS, H, D) = (QISOR(A,H, D)); in Q’p(As,H, D).

 

 

 

 

4.3.2 Computations

Fix a real number 6, and then we recall from subsection 1.1.1 that the C* algebra Ag
is the universal C* algebra generated by two unitaries U and V such that UV = AVU,
where \ := e278, We also recall from section 1.3 that Ag is a Rieffel type deformation
of C(T?) by using the canonical action of R? on T? and the skew symmetric matrix

orthonormal basis for L?(Ag,7), where 7 denotes the unique faithful normalized trace
on Ag given by, T(> @mnU™V™) = ago. We will denote the GNS space L?(Ag,7) by Ho.
Let Afn be the unital *-subalgebra generated by finite complex linear combinations of
U™V™", where m,n belong to Z, and d,, dz be the maps on Afp defined by d\(U™V") =
mU™V™, do(U™V") = nU™vV”.

We consider the spectral triple obtained from the classical spectral triple on T? as

J= . It is well-known (see [17]) that the set {U"V" : m,n € Z} is an

described in section 4.1.

Theorem 4.3.9. QISO (A%,H,D) = QISO'(C*(T2)) = C(T) « C(T), and
QISO* (Ax) = QISO+(C™(T2)) = C(T?).

Proof: We use Theorem 4.3.8 and recall that QISO+(C™(T?)) = C(T?) ( Theorem
3.4.14 ) which is generated by z and zo, say. QISO+(C™(T?)) contains C(T?) itself as a
quantum subgroup. Hence, by Theorem 4.3.8, QISO*(A%°) is the CQG obtained from
the Rieffel deformation of C(T?) via the action of R* and the skew symmetric matrix
