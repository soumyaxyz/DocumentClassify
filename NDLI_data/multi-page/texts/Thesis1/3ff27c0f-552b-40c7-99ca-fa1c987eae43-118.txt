Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 106

 

Hn := An€ of H and write Qo = Po = Poe, Qn = Pn — Pn-1 for n € IN. There exists a
(strictly increasing) sequence of real numbers (an )°, such that the self adjoint operator
D= new OnrQn yields a spectral triple (A®,H, D). Due to the existence of a cyclic
and separating vector the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries exists by
Theorem 3.2.22.

In [16], the following fact was also observed:

co

Proposition 3.5.2. If A is infinite-dimensional and p > 0 then one can choose (an)>4

in such a way that the spectral triple is p-summable. For this reasons, the spectral triple

should be thought of as 0-dimensional noncommutative manifolds.

Note that for each n € IN by restricting we obtain a (finite-dimensional) spec-
tral triple (An, Hn, D\n,,). AS we are precisely in the framework of Theorem 3.5.1,
to compute Q/SO*(A®,H, D) we need to understand the quantum isometry groups
QISO*T(A®, Hn, D\y,,) and embeddings relating them. To simplify the notation we
will write S, := QISO* (An, Hn, D\n,)-

We begin with some general observations.

Lemma 3.5.3. Let QU4,,2, denote the universal quantum group acting on A, and
preserving the (faithful) state on An given by vector € (see [60]). There exists a CQG
morphism from QUA, we t0 Sn:

Proof: The proof is based on considering the spectral triple given by (An,Hn, D),),
where D!, = P,,—P. It is then easy to see that QISOT (An, Hn, Di.) is isomorphic to the
universal compact quantum group acting on A, and preserving we. On the other hanc
universality assures the existence of the CQG morphism from QISO*(An, Hn, D},) to
Sn.

 

 

 

 

Lemma 3.5.4. Assume that each An is commutative, An = C*, n € IN. There exists
a CQG morphism from QUy,, to Sx,
acting on ky, points ( [60]).

where QU;,, denotes the universal quantum group

in?

Proof: We observe that for any measure jy on the set {1,...,k,} which has ful
support there is a natural CQG morphism from QU;,, to QUcrn ,,. In case when yp is

uniformly distributed, we simply have QU crn ,, = QUy,,, as follows from Lemma 1.2.33.

 

 

 

 

Let an : An + An ® Sp denote the universal action (on the n-th level). Then we
have the following important property, being the direct consequence of the Theorem
3.5.1. We have
