Theorem 5.4.16. The *-homomorphism a is not a C* action.

Proof : We begin with the observation that each of the C* algebras m4(S2 0) is
nothing but the Toeplitz algebra. For example, consider C := m+4(S7 .). Clearly, T =
a4.(B) in an invertible operator with the polar decomposition given by, T = 7|T|, hence
7 belongs to C. Thus, C contains the Toeplitz algebra C*(7,), which by Proposition
5.4.13 contains all compact operators. In particular, C*(7;) must contain 7,(A) as well
as all the eigenprojections P,, of |7.(B)| so it must contain the whole of C. Similar
arguments will work for n_(S?.).

Thus, tT = 71 © 71 = 7(B)|7(B)|7! belongs to 7(S? .). If a is a C* action, then for
an arbitrary state ¢ on QISO*(D) we must have ag(7) = (id @ $) 0 a(7) is in (97),
hence ag(7)P; must belong to C = m4 (Sie)s where P, denotes the projection onto
H+. By Proposition 5.4.13, this implies that [ag(r)P+,71] must be a compact operator.
We claim that for suitably chosen ¢, this compactness condition is violated, which will
complete the proof of the theorem.

To this end, fix an irrational number 0 and consider the sequence A, = e27” of
complex number of unit modulus. We note that the linear functionals which send the

generator of C(Z2)( which is y ) to 1 and the generator of the n-th copy of C(T) ( which
