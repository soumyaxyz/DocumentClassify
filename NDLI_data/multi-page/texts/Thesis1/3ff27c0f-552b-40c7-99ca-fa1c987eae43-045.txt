33 Quantum Groups

 

Proposition 1.2.32. Consider the category with objects as CQG s having a C* action
on C(Xn) and morphisms as CQG morphisms intertwining the actions as above. Then

OU, is the universal object in this category.
Now we note down a simple fact for future use.

Lemma 1.2.33. Let a be an action of a CQGS on C(X) where X is a finite set. Then

a automatically preserves the functional rT corresponding to the counting measure:

(7 @ id)(a(f)) = r(f)-1s.

Proof:
Let X = {1,...,n} for some n € JIN and denote by 6; the characteristic function of
the point i. Let a(6;) = Mi 6; © qij where {qij : i,j = 1...n} are the images of the
canonical generators of the quantum permutation group as above. Then 7-preservation

of a follows from the properties of the generators of the quantum permutation group,

 

 

 

which in particular imply that 5> jij = 1=, 4.

Wang also identified the universal object in the category of all CQG s having a C*

 

action a, on M,,(C) ( with morphisms as before ) such that the functional Tr is kep
invariant under a ;. However, no such universal object exists if the invariance of the
functional is not assumed. The precise statement is contained in the following theorem.

Before that, we recall that M,(C) = C*{ei; : eigen = Ojneut, ef, = ej, SG =
