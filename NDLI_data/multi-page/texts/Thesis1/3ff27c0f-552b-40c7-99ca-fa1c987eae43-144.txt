Chapter 4: Quantum isometry groups for Rieffel deformed manifolds 132

 

Proof : We have already seen in ( 4.2.10 ) that a is an algebra homomorphism
from Ap to Ao @alg Qo (w.r.t. the deformed products), and it is also *shomomorphism
since it is so for the undeformed case and the involution * is the same for the deformed
and undeformed algebras. It now suffices to show that a extends to Aj as a C*-
homomorphism. Let us fix any faithful imbedding Aj; C B(Ho) (where Ho is a Hilbert
space) and consider the imbedding Q; C B(L?(hz)) ( by virtue of Lemma 1.3.13 ).
By definition, the norm on A; ® Q; is the minimal (injective) C*-norm, so it is equal
to the norm inherited from the imbedding Ay @alg Q7C B(Ho @ L?(hz)). Let us
consider the dense subspace D C Ho ® L?(hz) consisting of vectors which are finite
linear combinations of the form >, u; ® 2;, with u; belonging to Ho, x; belonging to
Qo C L?(hz). Fix such a vector € = we u; ® x; and consider B := A ® M,;(C), with
the T”-action 3 @ id on B. Let ¢: A* — B® be the map given by
k

(0) = ((G4@ Mey N((@)), 5
where $(».y)(z) = h(a* x72 xzy) for x,y,z in Qo. By Remark 1.3.11, $(;,2,) extends
to Q as a bounded linear functional. Note that the range of ¢ is in B® = A® @ M;(C)
since we have (id @ ¢(z,y) )a(A®) C A® by Proposition 2.1.2, using our assumption (ii)
that (),,5; Dom(L") = A®.

Since a maps Ag into Ap @aig Qo and h = hj on Qo, it is easy to see that for a in
Ao, $(a* x 7a) is positive in By. As P(x;,e;) extends to Q as a bounded linear functional,
o extends to a bounded linear (but not necessarily positive) map from A to B. Thus,
the hypotheses of Lemma 4.4.3 are satisfied and we conclude that ¢ admits a positive
extension, say ¢,, from Az to By = Ay ® My(C). Thus, we have for a in Ao,

k
DE (ui, o(@* x 5 a)us)
ij=l
< lfalls So (ui, Aug) = Nally So (us, uy) h(a} x 729)
k
= lal So (ui @ xi, uj @ 23) = all5|| 0 ui @ il)”.
ij i=1
This implies
k
Ila(a)éll? = (E, aa" xy a)é) = SF (ui, O(a* xs a)uy) < lal FEI?
ij=l

for all € in D and a in Ap, hence a admits a bounded extension which is clearly a
