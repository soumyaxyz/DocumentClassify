into a Banach *-algebra by defining

(f *g)(t N= [16 f(s)g(s7t#)du(s),

f(t) =A) FE.

Here f, g are in L1(G), A is the modular homomorphism of G.
A has a distinguished representation Treg on L?(G) defined by Treg(f) =
J f(t)r(t)du(t) where x(t) is a unitary operator on L?(G) defined by (x(t) f)(g) =
fe ‘ (f € L?(G), t,g € G). The reduced group C* algebra of G is defined to be
an BIG.
O#(G) := Treg LG).
Remark 1.1.3. For G abelian, we have C}(G) = Co(G) where G is the group of

characters on G.

One can also consider the universal C* algebra described before corresponding to
the Banach *-algebra L(G). This is called the free or full group C* algebra and denoted
by C*(G).

Remark 1.1.4. For the so-called amenable groups ( which include compact and abelian

groups ) we have C*(G) = C*(G).

1.1.2 von Neumann algebras

We recall that for a Hilbert space H, the strong operator topology ( SOT ) , the
weak operator topology ( WOT ) and the ultra weak topology are the locally
convex topologies on B(H) given by families of seminorms F;, Fy, F3 respectively where
Fi= mn :€€H}, Fo = en :€,n €H}, Fs = {pp : p is a trace class operator on H}
and pe(x) = ||€||, pen(a) = |(xE,n)|, pp(x) = |Tr(xp)| ( where Tr denotes the usual
trace on B(H)).

Now we state a well known fact.

Lemma 1.1.5. If T, is a sequence of bounded operators converging to zero in SOT,

then for any trace class operator W, Tr(T,W) — 0 as n— co.

For any subset B of B(H), we denote by B’ the commutant of B, that is, B’ = {x €
B(H) : xb = be for all b € B}. A unital C* subalgebra A C B(H) is called a von
Neumann algebra if A = A” which is equivalent to being closed in any of the three
topologies mentioned above.

A state ¢ on a von Neumann algebra A is called normal if ¢(xq) increases to 6(x)

whenever xq increases to x. A state ¢ on A is normal if and only if there is a trace class
