39 Rieffel deformation

 

Then there is a R2” action on A defined by
X(s,u) = An(s)Pn(u)- (1.3.8)
Fix a skew symmetric matrix J on R” and put
J=J@(-J).

Then, by the prescription of Rieffel as described above, we have a C* algebra Aj.
Shuzhou Wang showed in [62] that A; can be made into a CQG.

The +-algebra generated by the matrix elements of unitary irreducible representa-
tions of A ( denoted by Ap ) is dense in the space A® of smooth vectors of the action
x under the Frechet topology and hence is dense in the C* algebra Aj under the C*
norm of Aj. On Ao, the Hopf +-algebra structure remains unchanged and this extends
to a CQG structure on Aj.

We quote the following result ( Remark 3.10 ( 2 ), [62] ) which will be used later.

Proposition 1.3.9. The Haar measure hz of Aj is still the same as the Haar measure

on the common subspace Apo.

Lemma 1.3.10. The Haar state (say h) of A coincides with the Haar state on Az (
say hy ) on the common subspace A®, and moreover, h(a x 7b) = h(ab) for a,b in AX.

Proof : We recall ( Proposition 1.3.9 ) that h = hy on Ao. By using h(Q(—s) @id) =
Q(—s)(id @ h) and h(id @ Q(u)) = Q(u)(h @ id), we have for a in Qo,

h(Xs,u(@))
= Q(—s)(id @ h)A(id @ N(u))A(a)
= 2-s)(h((id @ Q(u))A(a))1)
= h((id@ Q(u))A(a))
= Q(u)(h(a).1)

u(a).

Therefore,
hxXs,u(b) = h(b) for all b in Qo. (1.3.9)
