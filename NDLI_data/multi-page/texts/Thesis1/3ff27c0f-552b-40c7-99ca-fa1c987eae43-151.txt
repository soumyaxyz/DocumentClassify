139 QISO® of a Rieffel deformed noncommutative manifold

 

 

 

 

This proves the Lemma.

 

Remark 4.4.14. Proceeding similarly, one can prove Ao,,1 x7 Bora = Boas x7
Aoi, Aiao Xz Biso = Bio X7 Ato, A101 x7 B10 = Bio,1 x7 A1o0,1

and Aooa Xz Boo. = e(—20)Boo1 Xz Aoo1, A100 Xz Bio. = e(-20)Bioo x7
Ajoo, Aiaa x7 Bias = e(-20)Biia x7 Aria.

Let us now consider a C* algebra B, which has eight direct summands, four of which
are isomorphic with the commutative algebra C(T?), and the other four are irrational

rotation algebras. More precisely, we take
B= ©f_1C* (Uni, Ure),

where for odd k, Uxi, Up2 are the two commuting unitary generators of C(T?), and for
even k, Up U po = e(2710)U,.2U x1, that is they generate Agg.

Now we are in a position to describe QISO*(Ag) explicitly.

Theorem 4.4.15. QISO*£(Ag) is isomorphic with B = C(T?) @ Aog ® C(T?) © Axg ®
C(T?) © Ay @ C(T?) © Ago.

Proof : Define ¢: B + QISO£(Ag) by

o(Ui1) = Aooo, Oe = Booo, $(U21) = Aoio, o(U22) = Aoio, o(U31) =
Aou, ?(U32) = Bou, (Ua) = Aoor, (U2) = Boo, ¢(Us1) = Atso, @(Us2) =
Bio, o(Ue1) = Ain, ¢ uy Bin, (Um) = Aion, ¢(U72) = Bio, (Us1) =
Aioo, ?(Us2) = Bioo-

From Lemma 4.4.10 - Lemma 4.4.13 and Remark 4.4.14, it is clear that ¢ is indeec

a * isomorphism.

 

 

 

 

Remark 4.4.16. In particular, we note that if 0 is taken to be 1/2, then we have a com-
mutative compact quantum group as the quantum isometry group of a noncommutative

C* algebra.

The case of 6 deformed spheres

We can apply Theorem 4.4.7 on 57 which are obtained by Rieffel deformation of
C(S") as described in section 1.3. We will consider the isospectral deformation of
the classical spectral triple on C(S”). Since we have proved in Theorem 2.2.2 that
QISOL(S") = C(O(n)), it will follow that QISO*(S?) =~ Op(n), where Og(n) is the
compact quantum group discussed in subsection 1.3.1 as the 6-deformation of C(O(n)).
