Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 102

 

The vectors e; = (1, 0) and eg = (0, 1) form an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace
corresponding to the eigenvalue zero.

The Laplacian in the sense of chapter 2 exists in this case, and is given by
L(U™V") = —(m? + n?)U™V™. We recall that we denote the quantum isometry group
from the Laplacian L in the sense of [30] by QISO*?.

Lemma 3.4.13. Let (9, W) be an object of Q’(D). Then the x-homomorphism a = aw

must be of the following form:

a(U) =U x, (3.4.22)
a(V) =V®xz, (3.4.23)
where 21,22 are two commuting unitaries.

Proof: We denote the the maximal Woronowicz C* subalgebra of O which acts on
C(T?) faithfully by Q.

We observe that D?(ae;) = L(a)e; for i = 1,2. Now, W commutes with D implies
that W commutes with D? as well. Using this, we can show that (£ @ id)a(a)e; =
aL(a)e;, i= 1,2. As the pair {e1, e9} is together separating for C(T?), we conclude that
a commutes with the Laplacian £. Therefore, Q is a quantum subgroup of QI SOF,
From Theorem 2.2.17, we conclude that QISO£” = C(T? ><(Z2 ><1Z2)). Thus Q must
be of the form C(G) for a classical subgroup G of the orientation preserving isometry
group of T?, which is T? itself and whose (co )action is given by U + U @U an
ViVev.

Theorem 3.4.14. The universal CQG QISO (C%(T?),H, D) exists and is isomorphic
with C(T?) * C(T) = C*(Z? * Z) (as a CQG). Moreover, QISO* of this spectral triple
is isomorphic with C(T?).

Proof: Let (Q, W) be an object in Q’(D) as in Lemma 3.4.13. Since {e), e2} is an

orthonormal basis for an eigenspace of D, we must have

W(e1) =€1 @q1 + €2 @ MH, (3.4.24)

 

W (e2) = e1 @ qai + €2 @ gna, (3.4.25)

for some qj in Q.

We now make use of the equation (D @ id)W (Ue; © 1) = W(D@ id)(Ue; ® 1). Let
