79 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

 

Let us now fix a spectral triple (A~,H,D) which is of compact type. The C*-
algebra generated by A® in B(H) will be denoted by A. Let Ao = 0,1, A2,- ++ be the
eigenvalues of D with V; denoting the ( d;-dimensional, 0 < d; < oo ) eigenspace for j.
Let {eij;,7 = 1,...,d;} be an orthonormal basis of V;. We also assume that there is a
positive invertible R on H such that (A®,H,D, R) is an R-twisted spectral data. The
operator R must have the form Rly, = R;, say, with R; positive invertible d; x d; matrix.
Let us denote the CQG Ay¢; (RP) by U;, with its canonical unitary representation 3; on
V, = C%, given by Bile) = Wy eik @ ug. Let U/ be the free product of U;,i = 1, 2,...
and 3 = *;3; be the corresponding free product representation of / on H. We shall also

consider the corresponding unitary element 8 in M(K(H) @U).
Lemma 3.2.12. Consider the R-twisted spectral triple (A®,H,D) and let (S,U) be a

quantum family of volume and orientation preserving isometries of the given spectral
triple. Moreover, assume that the map U is faithful in the sense that there is no proper
C*-subalgebra S, of S such that U belongs to M(K(H) @ Si). Then we can find a C*-
isomorphism @:U/TI — S between S and a quotient of U by a C*-ideal I of U, such
that U = (id @ ¢) 0 (id ®@ Hz) 0 B, where Iz denotes the quotient map from U toU/T.

If, furthermore, there is a compact quantum group structure on S given by a coprod-
uct A such that (S,A,U) is an object in Q’p, the ideal T is a Woronowicz C*-ideal and
the C*-isomorphism ¢:U/I > S is a morphism of compact quantum groups.

Proof : It is clear that U maps V; into V; ® S for each i. Let of? (j,k =1,...,di) be
the elements of S such that U(ej;) =o, ei ® of Note that v; :-= ((of?)) is a unitary
in Ma,(C) ®S. Moreover, the *-subalgebra generated by all {ulti >0,,9,4 > 1} must
be dense in S by the assumption of faithfulness.

Consider the *-homomorphism a; from the finite dimensional C* algebra A; ~
Ma,(C) generated by the rank one operators {lei; >< eix|,j,k = 1,...,dj} to A; @S
given by a;(y) = U(y @ 1)U"ly,. Clearly, the restriction of the functional tz on A;
is nothing but the functional given by Tr(R; -), where Tr denotes the usual trace of
matrices. Since a; preserves this functional by assumption, we get, by the universality
of U;, a C*-homomorphism from U4; to S sending uf’) = ue to of,
of the free product, this induces a C*-homomorphism, say II, from UY onto S, so that
Uu/TL = S, where T := Ker(I1).

In case S has a coproduct A making it into a compact quantum group and U is a

and by definition

quantum group representation, it is easy to see that the subalgebra of S generated by

{of), i>0,j,k =1,...,d;} is a Hopf algebra, with A(of?) =>s; vl) ® of. From this,

it follows that II is Hopf-algebra morphism, hence Z is a Woronowicz C*-ideal.
