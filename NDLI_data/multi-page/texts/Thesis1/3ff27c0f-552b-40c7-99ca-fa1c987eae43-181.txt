169 Quantum Isometry Groups of the Podles sphere

 

Now we prove that QISOR(O(S?..), H, D) is commutative as a C* algebra. As
QISO}(O(S?..); H, D) is generated by To, T3, S2, $3, Sa, it is enough to show that
these elements belong to the centre of QISO}(O(S?..); H, D).

Lemma 5.3.37. T2, T3, S2, 53, S4, belong to the centre of QISOR(O(S2..), H, D).

Proof : Tz is self adjoint. From ( 5.3.41 ) and ( 5.3.42 ) we note that 73 is normal in
the case pp = 1. From Lemma 5.3.19 and ( 5.3.43 ), we deduce that Sz is normal in the
case pW = 1. Similarly, from Lemma 5.3.35 and Lemma 5.3.36 we obtain that $3 and S4
are normal. Hence, it is enough to show that the elements T>, 73, S2,.53,S4 commute
among themselves.

Now, from ( 5.3.49 ), Lemma 5.3.34, Lemma 5.3.33, Lemma 5.3.27 we get that Ty
commutes with T3,.$2,53,S4 respectively. From Lemma 5.3.28 and ( 5.3.15 ) we have
that T3 commutes with S2,.53 respectively. Now taking adjoint on the equation ( 5.3.16
) we obtain that T; commutes with Sj implying that T; commutes with S4. From
5.3.30 ) and ( 5.3.31 ), we have that S2 commutes with S3 and $4 respectively. Finally,
S3S4 = S453 follows from Remark 5.3.18.

 

 

 

 

From Lemma 5.3.37, we deduce the following.

Theorem 5.3.38. QISO}(O(S?,.),H, D) is commutative as a C* algebra and hence
coincides with the classical compact quantum group of orientation preserving isometries

of the sphere, that is, C(SO(3)).

Remark 5.3.39. Our characterization of SO,,(3) as the quantum isometry group of a
noncommutative Riemannian manifold generalizes the classical description of the group
SO(3) as the group of orientation preserving isometries of the usual Riemannian struc-
ture on the 2-sphere. It may be mentioned here that in a very recent article ( [54]), P.
M. Soltan has characterized SO,,(3) as the universal compact quantum group acting on
the finite dimensional C*-algebra Mz(C) such that the action preserves a functional w,
defined in [54]. In the classical case, we have three equivalent descriptions of SO(3):
(a) as a quotient of SU(2), (b) as the group of (orientation preserving) isometries of
S?, and (c) as the automorphism group of Mz. In the quantum case the definition of
SO,,(3) is an analogue of (a), so the characterization of SO,,(3) obtained in this paper
as the quantum isometry group, together with Soltan’s characterization, completes the

generalization of all three classical descriptions of SO(3).

 

5.3.6 Existence of Q/SO*+(D)

For the above spectral triple we have been unable to settle the issue of the existence
of QISO+(D) which is the universal object ( if it exists ) in the category Q’(D) men-

tioned in subsection 3.2.2. Nevertheless, we now show that if it exists, the Woronowicz
