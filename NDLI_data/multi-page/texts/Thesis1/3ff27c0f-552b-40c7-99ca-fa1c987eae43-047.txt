Let A® denote the space of smooth vectors for the action a, that is, A = {a €
A:v— a(a) is C™}.

Let {Xi Xo sescees Xn} be a basis of V and 6, denotes the operator of partial dif
ferentiation on A® in ‘the direction of X,.

For any multi index pw = (1, f2,..--/ln), we will let 6& = 6M15H2..5Hm, pl =

Hilfnl, [ul = do) wi. We will equip A® with the semi norms: llallje =

Let C,(V, A) ‘denote the Frechet space of continuous bounded functions from V to A,
equipped with the semi norms || f||, = supvev || f(v)||,,. There is also a natural action of
V on G(V, A) by translation and let C,,(V,A) denote the largest subspace of Cy(V, A)
on which this action is strongly continuous and let BA(V) denote the space of smooth
vectors with respect to this action.

Let W = V x V. Then B4(W) makes sense and for F in B4(W), one can define the
oscillatory integral [ f F(u,v)e(u.v)dudv ( where u.v denote the usual inner product )
in the following way:

We choose a basis of W and let L denote the lattice of points of W which have
integer co-ordinates w.r.t this basis. Moreover, choose a positive ¢9 in Co°(W) such
that ® = Ve ip vanishes nowhere on W where ¢, denotes the translate of @ by p
belonging to L. Let 6 = £2

It can be shown ( [46] ) that for F in BA(W), Mer J (Pop) (u, v)e(u.v)dudv con-
verges absolutely in A and ff F(u,v)e(u.v)dudv is defined to be this sum. Moreover,

this sum is independent of the choice of lattice and of ¢. Thus,

J fe u, v)e(u.v)dudv = > [i Foy) (u, v)e(u.v)dudv. (1.3.1)

For more details of oscillatory integral, we refer to [46] and references therein.

We will need the following results from [46].

Proposition 1.3.1. ( Corollary 1.12, [46] ) Let F be a function in BA(V x V) which
depends a on the first variable, so that it is essentially an element of BA(V). Then
ff[Fw e(u.v)dudv = F(0). The same is true if instead F depends only on the second

variable.

Proposition 1.3.2. ( Proposition 1.14, [46] ) Let S be a continuous linear transfor-
mation from A into a Frechet space C. Let F Cea to ae Then SoF belongs to
BC(W) and S(f f F(u, v)e(u.v)dudv) = f f SCF (u,v))e(u.v)dudv.

Now, let A be a Frechet algebra. Fix a skew symmetric matrix J on V. Then for all
a,b in A®, ajy(a)a,(b) belongs to B4(W) and a new product x ; is defined on A® by
declaring a x 7b = fy, fy, @ru(a)ay(b)e(u.v)dudv.
