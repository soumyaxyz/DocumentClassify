Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 90

 

by eigenvectors of A corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. Let {e;,,,:}; be an orthonormal
basis of V),;. Note that £p is the restriction of A to HY.

Now we recall Proposition 2.1.8. It was shown there that QI SOF? has a uni-
tary representation U = Ug on H¢+® such that U commutes with d+ d*. Thus,
(A®, Haar, d+d*) is a QISO*” equivariant spectral triple. Moreover, by Remark
2.1.6, QL. SO*> has tracial Haar state, which implies, by Proposition 3.2.7 and Remark
3.2.8 that au keeps the functional 7; invariant. Summarizing, we have the following

result:

Proposition 3.3.2. The quantum isometry group (QISOf?, Uz) is a sub-object of
(QISOF (d + d*), Uaszax) in the category Q;(d + d*), so in particular, QISOf® is
isomorphic to a quotient of QISO; (d + d*) by a Woronowicz C* ideal.

We shall give (under mild conditions) a concrete description of the above Woronowicz
ideal.
Let I be the C* ideal of QISO} (d+ d*) generated by
Ureotayt ((Pit ® id)Uasax(€jr0), €jr47 ® 1) : j,i > 1,

where P is the projection onto H}, (., .) denotes the QISOf(d + d*) valued inner
product and (A) denotes the spectrum of A.

Since Ugsa: keeps the eigenspaces of A = (d+ d*)? invariant, we can write

Ua+a* (eja0) = > €k0 @ kjr0 + s CRIN @ Uk'jri's
k i A0,k!

for some qxj,0, Wk’ jv in QISOT (d+ d*).
We note that qyjai is in Z if i! A 0.

Lemma 3.3.3. Z is a co-ideal of QISO} (d+ d*).

Proof : It is enough to prove the relation A(X) € Z® QISO} (d+ d*) + QISOF (d+
d*) ®T for the elements X in T of the form (( Po ® id)Ua+a«(€jr0), Erin ® 1) . We have:
A(((P @ id)Uasax(€mar0)s €jrig ® 1))

= (Rt @ id) (id @ A)Uaya* (Emo); €jri9 @ 1. @ 1))

= (Re ® id)U(12)U (13) (mao); €jrin @ 1B 1)
