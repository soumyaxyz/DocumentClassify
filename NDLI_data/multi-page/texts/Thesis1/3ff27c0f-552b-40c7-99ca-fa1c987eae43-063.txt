51 Noncommutative Geometry

 

2. It is QC™, that is, A*® and {[D,a], a € A™} are contained in the domains of
all powers of the derivation [|D],-].

3. The unbounded densely defined map dp from H$, to H}, given by dp(a) = [D, a]
for a in A®™, is closable.

4. £L:=—dhdp has A® in its domain, and it is left invariant by CL.

Under assumption 2., 7 defined by 7(X) = Limp MX) is a positive trace on
the C*-subalgebra generated by A® and {[D,a]: a€ A®}.

5. We assume that it is also faithful on this subalgebra.

Then, £ = —djdp is defined to be the Laplacian for the spectral triple (A®, H, D).
It coincides with the Hodge Laplacian —d*d (restricted on space of smooth functions)
in the classical case, where d denotes the de-Rham differential.

The linear span of eigenvectors of £, which is a subspace of A®, is denoted by Aj°,

and the *-subalgebra of A® generated by Aj® is denoted by Apo.
