Chapter 3: Quantum group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries 84

 

which clearly shows that s +> T,(X ) is L?-continuous for X belonging to S®, hence (by
unitarity of Ts) on the whole of N, that is, it is a strongly continuous one-parameter
group of unitaries. Let us denote its generator by é, which is a skew adjoint map, that
is, id is self adjoint, and T, = exp(td). Clearly, 6 = 5 = [D,-] on S™.

We will denote L?(A®,7) C N by H9, and the restriction of 5 to H°, (which is a
closable map from HY, to N) by dp. Thus, dp is closable too.

We now recall the assumptions made in chapter 2, subsection 2.1.2 for defining
the ‘Laplacian’ and the corresponding quantum isometry group of a spectral triple
(A®,H, D).

The following conditions will also be assumed throughout the rest of this subsection:

(3) A® C Dom(L) where L = Lp := —dpdp.

(4) £ has compact resolvent.
(5) Each eigenvector of £ ( which has a discrete spectrum , hence a complete set of
eigenvectors ) belongs to A.
(6) The complex linear span of the eigenvectors of £, say A§° ( which is a subspace of

A by assumption (5) ), is norm dense in A®.

It is clear that £ maps (A3°) into itself. The *-subalgebra of A® generated by Aj°
is denoted by Ag. We also note that L = Po£Po, where £ := (id)? (which is a self
adjoint operator on VV) and Po denotes the orthogonal projection in NM whose range is
the subspace HY.

Theorem 3.2.17. Let (A~®,H,D) be a spectral triple satisfying the assumptions
(1) — (6) made above. In addition, assume that at least one of conditions (a) and

(b) mentioned below is satisfied:

(a) A" CHS.
(b) af (A®) C A® for every state d on G = QISOF(D).

Then ag is a C*-action of QISO}(D) on A.

Proof : Under either of the conditions (a) and (b), for any fixed ¢, the map ag maps
A® into the subset H%, of NV. Since af also commutes with [D,-] on A®, it is clear
that ag maps S® into NV. In fact, using the complete positivity of the map ae and the

ao-invariance of 7, we see that

*

(ag (a) af (a)) < r(a$(a*a)) = (id ® 6)((7 @ id)ao(a*a)) = T(a*a).1

which implies that ag extends to a bounded operator from N to itself. Since Up com-

mutes with D, it is clear that ag (viewed as a bounded operator on NV) will commute
