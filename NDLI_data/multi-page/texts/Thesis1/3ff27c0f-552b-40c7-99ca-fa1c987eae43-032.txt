Chapter 1: Preliminaries 20

 

It can be easily seen that a kernel of a CQG morphism is a Woronowicz C*-ideal.

We recall the following isomorphism theorem.

Proposition 1.2.17. The quotient of a CQG (S,A) by a Woronowicz C*-ideal T has
a unique CQG structure such that the quotient map m is a morphism of CQG s. More
precisely, the coproduct A on S/T is given by A(s +Z) = (x @ m)A(s).

Definition 1.2.18. A CQG (8’,A’) is called a quantum subgroup of another CQG
(S,A) if there is a Woronowicz C*-ideal J of S such that (S’, A’) & (S,A)/J.

Let us mention a convention which we are going to follow. We shall use most of the
terminologies of [59], for example Woronowicz C* -subalgebra, Woronowicz C*-ideal etc,
however with the exception that we shall call the Woronowicz C* algebras just compact
quantum groups, and not use the term compact quantum groups for the dual objects
as done in [59].

Let (S, A) be a compact quantum group. Then there exists a state h on S, to be
called a Haar state on S such that (h ® id)A(s) = (id @ h)A(s) = h(s).1. We recall
that unlike the group case, h may not be faithful. But on the dense Hopf +-algebra So

mentioned above, it is faithful. We have the following result.

Proposition 1.2.19. Let i: S; — Sp» be an injective morphism of CQG s. Then the
Haar state on S, is the restriction of that of Sz on Sj.

Remark 1.2.20. In general, the Haar state might not be tracial. In fact, there exists a
multiplicative linear functional denoted by f, in [66] such that h(ab) = h(b(f1 <a> fi)).
Moreover, from Theorem 1.5 of [67], it follows that the Haar state of a CQG is tracial
if and only if K? = id.

Co-Representations of a compact quantum group

Definition 1.2.21. A co-representation of a compact quantum group (S, A) on a Hilbert
space H is a map U from H to the Hilbert S module H ®@S such that the element U
belonging to M(K(H) ® S) given by U(E ® b) = U(E)(1@b) (€ in H,b in S) satisfies

(id@ A)U = TarT as),

where for an operator X in B(H1@H2) we have denoted by X42) and X (13) the operators
X @ Ip, in BCH; ® He ® H2), and %93X (12) 23 respectively and Xo3 is the unitary on
Hi ® He ® He which flips the two copies of Ha.

If U is an unitary element of M(K(H) @ 8), then U is called a unitary co-

representation.
