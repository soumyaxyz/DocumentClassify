Chapter 5: Quantum isometry groups of the Podles spheres 150

 

This CQG can be identified with a Woronowicz subalgebra of SU,,(2) by taking:

 

 

N=77, M=ay, C=a7", G=7, L=c’,

where a,7¥ are as in subsection 1.2.4.

The canonical action of SU,(2) on Sei

the coproduct of SU,,(2) to the subalgebra S$?

fixe)

that is the action obtained by restricting
is actually a faithful action of SO,,(3).

With respect to the ordered basis {v_1, x, 71}, this action on the subspace gener-
ated by them is given by the following SO,,(3)-valued 3 x 3-matrix( [37] ):

1
a (se) ab b?
(ta?) “typo (ta)?
—T ac I+(q+q "be “t—bd
1
Ce Gr cd a?

( where a, b,c,d are as in subsection 1.2.5 ).
Recalling the correspondence in ( 1.2.26 ) and Proposition 5.1.1, the matrix in the

a, y notation is :

1
a? —p(L+ p?)Fary* eye
1; a, 2
(l+p?)Pay I pet+pertyyy —e(l+ uo)? yo"
oi
7 (1+ p-?)2ya* ar

Finally, in the symbols M, N,G,C,L, the above matrix is :

i ¢
L —p(1+p-?)?C p?G*
il 1
A= | (lty?)?M I-p(utp)N -p+p-?)2M* |. (5.2.5)

As %_1,%,%1 generates SP the Woronowicz subalgebra of SU,,(2) generated by the
elements of the form < €@1, Au(a)(7@1) > is SO,,(3) ( where €,7 are elements of H, a
belongs to O(S?..) and <-,- > is the SU,,(2)-valued inner product of H ® SU,(2) ).

5.3 Quantum Isometry Groups of the Podles sphere

Here we will compute QISO}(S2..) with respect to the spectral triple given in [24] and
show that it is isomorphic with SO,,(3).

Let (Q,U) be an object in the category Q’,(D) and Q be the Woronowicz C*
subalgebra of Q generated by < (€ @ 1), au(a)(n @ 1) >g, for €,7 belonging to H, a
belongs to Sie (where < -,- > is the 9 valued inner product of H @ Q). We shall
