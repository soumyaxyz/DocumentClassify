Thus, the set of eigenvalues of £ is countable, each having finite multiplicities, and
accumulating only at infinity. Moreover, there exists an orthonormal basis of L?(M)
consisting of eigenvectors of £ which belong to C™~(M). It can be shown ( Lemma 2.3
of [30] ) that for a compact manifold, the complex linear span of the eigenvectors of £

is dense in C™(M/) in the sup norm.

The following result is in the form in which it has been stated and proved in [30] (
Proposition 2.1 ).

Proposition 1.4.1. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. Let £L be the Laplacian
of M. A smooth map y: M > M is a Riemannian isometry if and only if y commutes

with L in the sense that L(f oy) = (L(f)) oy for all f in C™(M).

Using this fact, we give an operator theoretic proof of the fact that for a compact
manifold, [SO(M) is compact. As the action of [SO(M) commutes with the Laplacian,
it has a unitary representation on L?(M). As the action preserves the finite dimensional

eigenspaces of the Laplacian, [S'O(M) is a subgroup of U(d;) x U(d2) x ..... ..( where

 

{d; : i > 0} denote the dimension of the eigenspaces of the Laplacian and U(d) denotes
the group of unitary operators on a Hilbert space of dimension d ) which is a compact
group. As ISO(M) is closed, it is a closed subgroup of a compact group, hence compact.
We will see that this technique can be generalized in the noncommutative set-up in the
chapters 2 and 3.

Proposition 1.4.1 has the generalization in a more general context.

Let us fix some notations. Let Y be a compact metrizable space and @: MxY — M.
Let €y : M — M defined by &(m) = 0(m,y). Let a : C(M) > C(M)@C(Y) =
C(M x Y) be defined by a(f)(m,y) = f(0(m,y)) for all y in Y, m in M. For a state
@ on C(Y), denote by ag, the map: (id @ ¢)a : C(M) — C(M). Lastly, let A3° be the
span of eigenvectors of the Laplacian £ of M.

Then, we have the following( Lemma 2.5 of [30] ):

Proposition 1.4.2. The following are equivalent:

a. For every y in Y, &y is smooth isometric.
b. For every state bd on O(Y), we have ag(Ag°) C AX? and agl = Lag on AR.

Example 1.4.3. 1. The isometry group of the n-sphere S” is O(n+1) where the action
is given by the usual action of O(n +1) on R"*!. The subgroup of O(n +1) consisting
of all orientation preserving isometries on S” is SO(n + 1).
2. The isometry group of the circle S' is S! ><Zy. Here the Zp ( = {0,1} ) action
on S! is given by 1.2 =Z where z is in S' while the action of S! is its action on itself.
3. ISO(T") = T" ><(Z} ><S,) where S;, is the permutation group on n sym-

bols. Here an element of S, acts on an element (21, 22,.-.,2n) € T” by permutation.
