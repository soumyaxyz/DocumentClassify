67 Computation of QISO*

 

Proof : From Lemma 2.2.6, we have Aj; Aj; = 0 for all k £1.

Applying « and taking adjoint, we have Aj,Aj = 0 for all k # 1. Interchanging k
and |, we get Aj Ajz = 0 for all k Al. Hence, Aj, Ajj = Aj Aix for all k Al.

From Lemma 2.2.6, we have Aj,Ajz = 0 for all i 4 j. Interchanging i and j, we have
AjrAix = 0 for all i 4 j.

 

 

 

 

Remark 2.2.16. Proceeding in an exactly similar way, we have that B,;’s commute

among themselves.

Theorem 2.2.17. The Quantum isometry group of C(T") is commutative as a C*

algebra and hence coincides with the classical isometry group C(T” ><(Z} ><1Sn)).

Proof : Follows from the results in lemma 2.2.11 - 2.2.15 and the remark following

 

them.
