Chapter 1: Preliminaries 34

 

(1) QU yp, (c),47 is a CQG with coproduct A defined by A(afi) = rest ak! @
ars, i,9,k,l=1,2,...,n.

(2) WM yp, (c),17 has a C* action a, on Mn(C) given by ar(eiyj) = het en ®
ri i,j = 1,2,...,n. Moreover, QU vy,(c), 20 is the universal object in the category of
all CQG s having C* action on M,(C) such that the functional ATy is kept invariant

a,

under the action.
(8) There does not exist any universal object in the category of all CQG s having
C* action on M,(C).

Proposition 1.2.35. Since, any faithful state on a finite dimensional C* algebra A is
of the form Tr(Ra) for some operator R, it follows from Theorem 6.1, ( 2) of [60] that
the universal CQG acting on any finite dimensional C* algebra preserving a faithful

state @ exists and is going to be denoted by QUA 4g.

Notations:

We conclude this section on quantum groups by fixing some notations which will be
used throughout this thesis. In particular, given a compact quantum group (S, A), the
dense unital Hopf *-subalgebra of S generated by the matrix elements of the irreducible
unitary representations will be denoted by So. Moreover, given an action 7: B — B&S
of the compact quantum group (S, A) on a unital C*-algebra B, the dense, unital *-
subalgebra of B on which the action becomes an action by the Hopf *-algebra Sp will be
denoted by Bo. We shall use the Sweedler convention of abbreviating y(b) € Bo@aigSo by
bi) ® by, for b in Bo. This applies in particular to the canonical action of the quantum
group S on itself, by taking y = A.

Moreover, for a linear functional f on S and an element c in So we recall the
‘convolution’ maps f <c := (f @ id)A(c) and cp f := (id @ f)A(c). We also define
convolution of two functionals f and g by (f  g)(c) = (f ® g)(A(c)).

1.3. Rieffel deformation

In this section, we recall the notions of Rieffel’s formulation of deformation quantization
( [46] ) as well as Rieffel type deformation of CQG s due to Rieffel and Wang ( as in [47]
and [62] ).

We begin with Rieffel deformation ( as in [46] ) from action of R" on a C* algebra.
In the following discussion and henceforth, the symbol e(a) will stand for e?”"”. Let V be
a real vector space of dimension n and a be its strongly continuous isometric action on
a complex Frechet space A. Let {||||;} denote the family of seminorms which determine
the topology of A. It is assumed that a is isometric for each of the given seminorms on

A.
