11 Operator algebras and Hilbert modules

 

that ¢'(a+Zo) = ||c+Z||. Thus, ¢’ is in K, so ||~+TZo|| = '(@+Z) < y < w(a+Z)—e.
But this implies ||” + Zo|| < || +Z|| + § < w(w + Zo) — § < ||a + Zol| — € (since w is a

 

 

 

 

state), which is a contradiction completing the proof.

For a C* algebra A ( possibly non unital ), its multiplier algebra, denoted by M(.A),
is defined as the maximal C* algebra which contains A as an essential two sided ideal,
that is, A is an ideal in M(A) and for y in M(A), ya = 0 for all a in A implies y = 0.
The norm of M(A) is given by ||x|| = supgea,jal<i{l|£@l], ||ax|]}. There is a locally
convex topology called the strict topology on M(A), which is given by the family of
seminorms {|j.||,,,@ € A}, where ||a||, = Max(||xal] , ||az|]), for « in M(A). M(A) is the

completion of A in the strict topology.

We now come to the inductive limit of C* algebras . Let I be a directed set
and {A;}ier be a family of C* algebras equipped with a family of C* homomorphisms
i; : Aj — Ai ( when j <i ) such that ®;; = ©,,; when j < k < i. Then there
exists a unique C* algebra denoted by lim;A; and C* homomorphisms @¢; : A; > lim;A;

with the universal property that given any other C* algebra A’ and C* homomorphisms

 

Wj: A; > A’ satisfying Yj = UY; Pi; for j < i, then there exists unique C* homomorphism

 

x : lim;A; — A’ satisfying yd; = yj. lim;A; is called the inductive limit C* algebra
corresponding to the inductive system (A;,®,;). Inductive limit of a sequence of finite
dimensional C* algebras are called approximately finite dimensional C* algebras or AF

algebras.

A large class of C* algebras are obtained by the following construction. Let Ag
be an associative +-algebra without any a-priori norm such that the set F = {zm :
Ap — B(Hx) * —homomorphism, H; a Hilbert space} is non empty and ||.||, defined
by |la||u = sup{||z(a)|| : « € F} is finite for all a. Then the completion of Apo in |.||u is

a C* algebra known as the universal C* algebra corresponding to Ao.

Example 1: Noncommutative two-torus

Let 6 belongs to [0,1]. Consider the * algebra Ap generated by two unitary symbols
U and V satisfying the relation UV = e?"VU. It has a representation 7 on the Hilbert
space L?(S') defined by m(U)(f)(z) = f(e?™z), m(V)(f)(z) = zf(z) where f is in
L?(S1), z isin St. Then |Ja\l,, is finite for all a in Ao. The resulting C* algebra is called

noncommutative two-torus and denoted by Ag.

Example 2: Group C* algebra

Let G be a locally compact group with left Haar measure ju. One can make L1(G)
