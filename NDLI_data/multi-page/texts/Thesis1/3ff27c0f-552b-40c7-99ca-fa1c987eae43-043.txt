1.2.6 The Wang algebras

Let us now recall the universal quantum groups as in [61], [59] and references therein.
For an n x n positive invertible matrix Q = (Qij). let Aun(Q) be the compact quantum
group defined and studied in [60], [61], which is the universal C*-algebra generated by
{uz k, j = 1,...,n} such that u:= ((ug,)) satisfies

uu* =I, =u*u, wQuQ7 = In = QuQchu’. (1.2.29)

Here u! = ((uji)) and @ = ((uj;)). The coproduct, say A, is given by,

n
A(uij) 7 Sous, ® tig
k=1
It may be noted that A,(Q) is the universal object in the category of compact quan-
tum groups which admit an action on the finite dimensional C* algebra M,,(C) which
preserves the functional M,, > x ++ Tr(Q?x),( see [63] ) where the notion of a CQG and
that of preservation of a functional by an action are as in subsection 1.2.7. We refer
the reader to [61] for a detailed discussion on the structure and classification of such

quantum groups.

Remark 1.2.29. It was proved in [59] that in the case where Q = I, K(ul,) = ult and
hence «? = id holds for Aun(Z).

1.2.7 Action of a compact quantum group on a C” algebra

We say that the compact quantum group (S, A) (co)-acts on a unital C* algebra B, if
there is a unital C*-homomorphism (called an action) a : B + B® S satisfying the
following :

(bi) (a @ id) oa@ = (id @ A) oa, and
