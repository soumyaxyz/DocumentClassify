111 Deformation of spectral triple

 

IR” and we denote by e and € respectively the corresponding exponential maps, so that
e(u) = e(2miu),u € R" and 7(é€(u)) = e(u). By a slight abuse of notation we shall
denote the R”-action G.(,) by Bu.

Assumption:
There exists a strongly continuous unitary representation Vz , g € T" of T” on H such
that
(a) VgD = DV; for all g,
(b) Vgr0(a)V~t = 770((g(a)), where a belongs to A, g belongs to T”, and g = ¥(g).

We shall now show that we can ‘deform’ the given spectral triple along the lines
of [19]. For each J, the map 7 : A® — Lin(H®) (where H® is the smooth subspace
corresponding to the representation V and Lin(V) denotes the space of linear maps on

a vector space V) defined by
Ty(a)s =axssi= [ [aula Bo(s)e(ue)dude

extends to a *-representation of the C*-algebra A™® in B(H) where Bo = Va) ( which
clearly maps H® into H®).

We can extend the action of T” on the C* subalgebra A; of B(H) generated by
m(A), {e? : t € R} and elements of the form {[D,a] : a € AX} by 8,(X) = VgXV5—t
for all X in A; where by an abuse of notation, we denote the action by the same symbol
B. Let Af° denote the smooth vectors of A; with respect to this action. We note that
for all a in AP’, [D,a] belongs to AP.

Lemma 4.1.3. 3 is a strongly continuous action (in the C*-sense) of T” on A, and
hence for all X in Ai, m7(X) defined by

m(X)s= ff Byu(X)Bu(s)e(ur)dude

is a bounded operator.

Proof: We note that ( is already strongly continuous on the C* algebra generated
by 70(A), {e? : t © R}. Thus it suffices to check the statement for elements of the
form [D,a] where a belongs to A®.

To this end, fix any one parameter subgroup g of T” such that g; goes to the
identity of T” as t > 0. Let TY, Ty denote the group of normal +-automorphisms on
B(H) defined by Ti(X) = Vg. XV,-1 and T(X) = e#?Xe~*P. As Vz, and D commute,
so do the generators of T/ and T; . In particular, each of these generators leave the
domain of the other invariant. Note also that A® is in the domain of the both the

generators, and the generator of T; is given by [D, -] there. Thus, for a in A®, we have
