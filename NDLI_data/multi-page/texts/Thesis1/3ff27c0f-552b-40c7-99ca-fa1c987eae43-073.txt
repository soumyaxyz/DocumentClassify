61 Computation of QISO*

 

Since P is a positive element in Qo and h is faithful on Qo, h(P) = 0 if and only if
P=0. Similarly , h(P+) = 0, that is h(P) = 1, if and only if P = 1. However, if P
is either 0 or 1, clearly Q = C*(U, P) = C*(U), which is commutative. On the other
hand, if we assume that P is not a trivial projection, then h(P) is strictly between 0
and 1, and we have from ( 2.2.11 )

n(P) a

UPLU" = Toy

Since both UP+U~! and P+ are nontrivial projections, they can be scalar multiples

of each other if and only if they are equal, so we conclude that UP+U~! = P+, that is

 

 

 

U commutes with Pt, hence with P, and Q is commutative.

 

2.2.3. The commutative n-tori

Consider C(T”) as the universal commutative C* algebra generated by n commu

ing unitaries U1,U2,.....Un. It is clear that the set {U"UP : m,n € Z} is an

orthonormal basis for L?(C(T"),7), where 7 denotes the unique faithful normal
ized trace on O(T”) given by, 7o(>> GmnU"UP) = ago which is just the integration
against the Haar measure. We shall denote by (A,B) = 7 (A*B) the inner proc
uct on Hy := L2(C(T"),7). Let C(T")™ be the unital »-subalgebra generated by
finite complex linear combinations of U"V", m,n € Z. The Laplacian CL is given by
LIU. UI) = —(m2 + ...m2 Ul"... Ur", and it is also easy to see that the al

gebraic span of eigenvectors of £ is nothing but the space ocr)™, and moreover, all

the assumptions 1. - 6. in subsection 2.1.2 required for defining the quantum isometry

group are satisfied.

 

Let QISO® be the quantum isometry group coming from the above Laplacian, with
the smooth isometric action of QISO* on C(T") given by a : C(T") = C(T")@QISOF.
By definition, a must keep invariant the eigenspace of £ corresponding to the eigenvalue
—1, spanned by Uj,.....Un, u;}, wue,U, +. Thus, the action a is given by:

n n
aU) =} Uj @ Aig + D0 U;* @ By,
j=l j=l
where Aj;, By; are in QI SOF, i,j =1,2....n. By faithfulness of the action of quantum
isometry group, the norm-closure of the unital *-algebra generated by { Ajj, Bij: i,j =
1,2,....n} must be the whole of QISOF.
Next we derive a number of conditions on Aj;;, Bij,i, 7 = 1,2, ...n using the fact that

a is a * homomorphism.
