Ain Bjr =0 = Bir Aix, (2.2.39)
Ani Brj = 0 = Brj Ani (2.2.40)
for alli #9 and for all k.

Proof : By Lemma 2.2.6, we have Aj,Bjy = 0 and Bj, As, = 0 for all i A j. The
second relation along with the fact that Aj, is a normal partial isometry implies that
By Aix = 0 for all i A j.

Thus, Aj, Bj, = 0 = BjpAjx for all i F j.

Applying « on the above equation and using B,; and Aj; are normal partial isome-
tries, we have Ajj Bj = 0 = Bry Axi-

 

 

 

 

Lemma 2.2.13. : AjrBir = Bip Aix for all i, k.

Proof : We have Aj, Bi; =0= Bi Ai; from Lemma 2.2.5. Using the fact that
By; and Aj; are normal partial isometry we have Aj, Bi; =0= Bi Ai; and hence
Ai Bij = Bi Aaj.

 

 

 

 

Lemma 2.2.14. :
Aj Aji = Aji Aix for alli Z d; k x ts

Proof : Using ( 2.2.29 ) in Lemma 2.2.10, we proceed as in Lemma 2.2.11 to get
Ran(Aj,Aji— Aj Aix) Cc Ran(AjAj,+ Aix Ajj.) and Ran(Aj,Ay—AuAjx) Cc Ran(Ay A+

We claim that (Ap AR, af Aji Aji) (Agr Ajp + Ay A%) =0.

Then by the same reasonings as given in Lemma 2.2.11 we will have : Aj, Ay =
AyAjr-

To prove the claim, we use Aj,Aj, = 0 for alli 4 j from Lemma 2.2.6 ( which implies
Aj, Aik = 0 for all i 4 j as Ajx is a normal partial isometry ), AZAR, = 0 for all k Al
from Lemma 2.2.7 ( which implies A7Aj, = 0 for all k #1 as Ajx is a normal partial
isometry ) and Ay Aj, = 0 for all i ¢ j from Lemma 2.2.6 ( which implies Aj Ait = 0 for

all i 4 j as A¥ is a normal partial isometry ).
