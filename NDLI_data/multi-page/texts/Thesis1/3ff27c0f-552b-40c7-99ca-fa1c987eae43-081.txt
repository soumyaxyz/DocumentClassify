Quantum group of orientation

preserving Riemannian isometries

3.1 Introduction

The formulation of quantum isometry groups in [30] had a major drawback from the
viewpoint of noncommutative geometry since it needed a ‘good’ Laplacian to exist. In
noncommutative geometry it is not always easy to verify such an assumption about the
Laplacian, and thus it would be more appropriate to have a formulation in terms of the
Dirac operator directly. This is what we aim to achieve in the present chapter.

The group of Riemannian isometries of a compact Riemannian manifold M can
be viewed as the universal object in the category of all compact metrizable groups
acting on M, with smooth and isometric action. Moreover, let us assume that the
manifold has a spin structure (hence in particular orientable, so we can fix a choice of
orientation) and D denotes the conventional Dirac operator acting as an unbounded
self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space H of square integrable spinors. Then, it can
be proved that a group action on the manifold lifts as a unitary representation on the
Hilbert space 7 which commutes with D if and only if the action on the manifold is an
orientation preserving isometric action. Therefore, to define the quantum analogue of
the group of orientation-preserving Riemannian isometries of a possibly noncommutative
manifold given by a spectral triple (A®,H, D), it is reasonable to consider a category
Q’ of compact quantum groups having unitary (co-) representation, say U, on H, which
commutes with D, and the action on B(H) obtained by conjugation maps A into its
weak closure. A universal object in this category, if it exists, should define the ‘quantum
group of orientation preserving Riemannian isometries’ of the underlying spectral triple.
It is easy to see that any object (S,U) of the category Q’ gives an equivariant spectral
triple (A®,H, D) with respect to the action of S implemented by U. It may be noted
