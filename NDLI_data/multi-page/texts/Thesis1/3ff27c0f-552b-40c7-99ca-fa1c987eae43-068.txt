Chapter 2: Quantum isometry groups: approach based on Laplacian 56

 

If furthermore, there is a CQG structure on S given by a coproduct A such that a
is a C* action of a CQG on A, then the map a: A*® — A® @S extends to a unitary
representation ( denoted again by a ) of the CQG (S,A) on H},. In this case, the ideal
I is a Woronowicz C* ideal and the C* isomorphism  : U/I — S is a morphism of

CQG s.

Using this, the following result has been proved in [30], which defines and gives the
existence of QISO%.

Theorem 2.1.5. For any admissible spectral triple (A®,H, D), the category Q£ has a
universal object denoted by (QISO£, ao). Moreover, QISO® has a coproduct Ao such
that (QISO®, Ao) is a CQG and (QISO®, Ao, ao) is a universal object in the category
Q’.. The action ag is faithful.

We very briefly outline the main ideas of the proof. The universal object QISO® is
constructed as a suitable quotient of U/. Let F be the collection of all those C*-ideals Z
of U such that the composition 'z = (id @ Iz) 0 8 : Aj? > AjP @aig (U/Z) extends to a
C*-homomorphism from A to A® (U/T). Then it can be shown that Zp (=A zerT ) is

again a member of F and (U/Zo, I'z,) is the required universal object. Thus,

Remark 2.1.6. QISO® is a quantum subgroup of the CQGU = *j Aya, (1). As Ava; (J)
satisfies K? = id, ( by Remark 1.2.29 ) the same is satisfied by QISOE® so that by Remark
1.2.20, QISO£ has tracial Haar state.

Remark 2.1.7. It is proved in [30] that to ensure the existence of QISO®, the as-
sumption (5) can be replaced by the condition that the action a is T preserving, that
is, (tT ® id)a(a) = r(a).1. In [30] it was also shown ( Lemma 2.5, b => a ) that for
an isometric group action on a not necessarily connected classical manifold, the volume
functional is automatically preserved. It can be easily seen that the proof goes verbatim
for a quantum group action, and consequently we get the existence of QISOf for a (

not necessarily connected ) compact Riemannian manifold.

Unitary representation of QISO* on a spectral triple

We shall also need the following result proved in section 2.4 of [30].

Proposition 2.1.8. QISO£ has a unitary representation U = Ug on Hp such that U
commutes with d+d*. Let 6 be as in subsection 1.5.2. On the Hilbert space of k-forms,
that is. Hh, U is defined by:

U({ao5(a1) ---5(ax)] @ g) = [a 5(a\?) ---5(a)] @ (@Pa ---a?))g,
