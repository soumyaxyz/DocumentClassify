Proposition 3.2.7. Given a spectral triple (A®,H,D) (of compact type) which is Q-
equivariant with respect to a representation of a CQG Q on H, we can construct a
positive (possibly unbounded) invertible operator R on H such that (A~,H,D, R) is a
twisted spectral data, and moreover, we have

ay preserves the functional Tr defined at least on a weakly dense *-subalgebra Ep of
B(H) generated by the rank-one operators of the form | >< n| where €,1 are eigenvec-
tors of D, given by

TR(«) =Tr(Re), xe Ep.

Remark 3.2.8. When the Haar state of Q is tracial, then it follows from the definition
of R in Lemma 3.1 of [31] and Theorem 1.5 part 1. of [67] that R can be chosen to be
Te

Remark 3.2.9. If V) denotes the eigenspace of D corresponding to the eigenvalue, say
A, it is clear that TR(X) = ec’ Tr(Re~?” X) for all X = |€ >< n| with €,n belonging to
Vy and for anyt > 0. Thus, the ay-invariance of the functional TR on Ep is equivalent
to the ay-invariance of the functional X Tr(X Re~"?”) on Ep for each t > 0. Tf,
furthermore, the R-twisted spectral triple is O-summable in the sense that Re)” is
trace class for every t > 0, the above is also equivalent to the ay-invariance of the

bounded normal functional X +> Tr(X Re~?”) on the whole of B(H). In particular,

this implies that ay preserves the functional B(H) > x > Limo Foe where

Lim is as defined in subsection 1.5.2.
This motivates the following definition:

Definition 3.2.10. Given an R-twisted spectral data (A~,H,D,R) of compact type,
a quantum family of orientation preserving isometries (S,U) of (A®,H,D) is said to
preserve the R-twisted volume, (simply said to be volume-preserving if R is understood)
if one has (Tr ® id)(ay(x)) = TR(x).1g for all x in Ep, where Ep and TR are as in
Proposition 3.2.7. We shall also call (S,U) a quantum family of orientation-preserving
isometries of the R-twisted spectral triple.

If, furthermore, the C*-algebra S has a coproduct A such that (S, A) is a CQG and
U is a unitary representation of (S,A) on H, we say that (S,A) acts by volume and
orientation-preserving isometries on the R-twisted spectral triple.

We shall consider the categories Qr = Qr(D) and Qi, = Q),(D) which are the full
subcategories of Q and Q! respectively, obtained by restricting the object-classes to the

volume-preserving quantum families.

Remark 3.2.11. We shall not need the full strength of the definition of twisted spectral
data here; in particular the third condition in the definition 3.2.6. However, we shall
continue to work with the usual definition of R-twisted spectral data, keeping in mind

that all our results are valid without assuming the third condition.
