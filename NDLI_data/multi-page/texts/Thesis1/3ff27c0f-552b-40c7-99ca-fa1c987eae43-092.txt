universal (initial) object, say G, Uo). Moreover, G has a coproduct Ao such that G, Ao)
is a compact quantum group and G, Ao, Up) is a universal object in the category Q'p.

The representation Up is faithful.

Proof : Recall the C*-algebra U considered before, along with the representation
@ and the corresponding unitary B belonging to M(K(H) ®@U). For any C*-ideal
T of U, we shall denote by IIz the canonical quotient map from UY onto U/T, and let
Tz = (id@Iz)of8. Clearly, Pz = (id@rz)0/3 is a unitary element of M(K(H)@U/Z). Let
F be the collection of all those C*-ideals Z of U such that (id@w)oar, = (id@w)o ade;
maps A® into A” for every state w (equivalently, every bounded linear functional) on
U/T. This collection is nonempty, since the trivial one-dimensional C*-algebra C gives
an object in Qr and by Lemma 3.2.12 we do get a member of F. Now, let Zp be the
intersection of all ideals in F. We claim that Zp is again a member of F. Indeed, in the
notation of Lemma 1.1.2, it is clear that for a in A®, (id @ @) oT'z,(a) belongs to A”
for all ¢ in the convex hull of QU(—Q). Now, for any state w on U/Zp, we can find,
by Lemma 1.1.2, a net w; in the above convex hull (so in particular ||w;|| <1 for all j)
such that w(a# + Zo) = lim; w;(% + Zp) for all x in U/Tp.

It follows from Lemma 1.1.8 that (id®w;)(X) — (id@w)(X) (in the strong operator
topology) for all X belonging to M(K(H) ®U/Zo). Thus, for a in A®, (id@w) 00%, (a)

is the limit of (id @ w;) 0 ax

7, (a) in the strong operator topology, hence belongs to A”

We now show that (G :=U/Zo,'z)) is a universal object in Qg. To see this, consider
any object (S,U) of Qr. Without loss of generality we can assume U to be faithful,
since otherwise we can replace S by the C*-subalgebra generated by the elements { vy
appearing in the proof of Lemma 3.2.12. But by Lemma 3.2.12 we can further assume
that S is isomorphic with U//Z for some T belonging to F. Since Zy C ZT, we have a
C*-homomorphism from U/Zp onto U/T, sending x + Ip to x + Z, which is clearly a
morphism in the category Qr. This is indeed the unique such morphism, since it is
uniquely determined on the dense subalgebra generated by {ul +p, i>0, j,k >1}
of G.

To construct the coproduct on G = U/Tp, we first consider U2 :HsH® G 9) G
given by

U®) = (Py)a2(Cx)as):

where Uj; is the usual ‘leg-numbering notation’. It is easy to see that G @G. ,U (2)) is an
object in the category Qpr, so by the universality of (G, T'z,), we have a unique unital

C*-homomorphism Ao : G = G ® G satisfying

(id @ Ao) (Tz) =U).
