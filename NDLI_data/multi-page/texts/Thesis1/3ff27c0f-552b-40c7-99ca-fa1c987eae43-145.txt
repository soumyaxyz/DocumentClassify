133 QISO® of a Rieffel deformed noncommutative manifold

 

For any two objects S; and S2 in Q*), we write S} <¢ S2 if S; is a sub-object of S2
in the category Q/.
Lemma 4.4.6. If Gi, Gp be two CQG s such that Gi <c G2 in the category
Qi (A, H, D). If (Gi)z and (G2)z make sense, then (Gi)7 <c (G2)z in the category
Q)(Az, H, D).

Proof : By Remark 4.4.4, (G;)z are objects in the category Q/.(Aj), i = 1,2. The

rest of the proof is the same as that of Lemma 4.3.7 and hence we omit it.

 

 

 

 

Theorem 4.4.7. If the Haar state on QISO£(A) is faithful, we have the isomorphism

of compact quantum groups:
(QISO*(A));7 & QISO*(Aj).

Proof : By Theorem 4.4.5, we have seen that (QISO£(A)); also acts faithfully,
y , ; y,

smoothly and isometrically on Az, which implies,
(QISO*(A,H, D))7 < QISO*(As,H,D) in Q;(As,H, D).

The rest of the proof is same as that of Theorem 4.3.8 by using Lemma 4.4.6 and hence

 

 

 

we omit it.

 

4.4.2 Computations
The case of the noncommutative tori

We recall ( chapter 1 ) that the noncommutative n-tori Tj is the universal C* algebra
generated by n unitaries U;,U2,...,Un such that U;jU; = e(0;;)UjUi, i,9,= 1,2,..n
where @ = ((6;;)) is an x n skew symmetric matrix. We also recall that Tj is a Rieffel
deformation of C(T") via the R” action on C(T”) ( section 1.3 ) and the matrix J = g.

We consider the isospectral deformation of the classical spectral triple on C(T”)
which will give a spectral triple on Tj. so that the corresponding Laplacian L is given
by £(U{™...U™) = —(mi + ..m2)Uy"...U, and it is also easy to see that all the

assumptions in chapter 2 required for defining QI. SOL(TH) are satisfied.

Theorem 4.4.8. Using Theorem 4.4.7, we conclude that QISO*(T?) is a Rieffel de-
formation of QISO£(C(T")).

Next, we will use Theorem 4.4.7 to compute the exact structure of QISO*(As).
Our target is to show that QIS OF(A 1) is a commutative C* algebra which will give an
2

example of a non commutative C* algebra with QISO* a commutative CQG.
