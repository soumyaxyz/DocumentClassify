and the comparison of the formulas above yields exactly ( 3.5.2 ).

 

One can deduce from the above lemma the exact structure of generators and relations
between them for each S,, associated with a commutative AF algebra. To be precise, if
An = C* for some kn € IN, then the quantum isometry group S,, is generated as a unital
C*-algebra by the family of self adjoint projections Uj_,{@a,,3, : 0,0) = 1,--- , ki}
such that for each fixed i = 1,...,n the family {a(q,,g,) : ai, 8; = 1,--- , ki} satisfies

the relations of QU/;,, and the additional relations between a(q, g,) and ay for

i€ {1,...,n—1} are given by the formulas ( 3.5.2 ), after suitable reinterpretation of

indices according to the multiplicities in the embedding of C* into C+.
