Remark 3.4.15. The canonical grading on C(T?) is given by the operator (id ® yy) on
0 1
-1 0
The representation of C(T?) * C(T) clearly commutes with the grading operator and

hence is isomorphic with QISO(C(T?), L?(T? @ C?), D, 7).

L?(T? @ C?) where y is the matrix

Remark 3.4.16. This example shows that the conditions of Theorem 3.2.22 are not

necessary for the existence of QISO*.

3.5.1 Inductive limit construction for quantum isometry groups

In this section we use the limiting construction for an inductive system of compact:
quantum groups ( Lemma 1.2.25 ) and give an application for quantum isometry groups
which is fundamental for the results of the next section.

The next theorem connects the inductive construction done in Lemma 1.2.25 with

some specific quantum isometry groups.

Theorem 3.5.1. Suppose that A is a C*-algebra acting on a Hilbert space H and that
D is a (densely defined) self adjoint operator on H with compact resolvent, such that
D has a one-dimensional eigenspace spanned by a vector € which is cyclic and separat-
ing for A. Let (AP°)nem be an increasing net of a unital *-subalgebras of A and put
A® = Unemw A?. Suppose that A® is dense in A and that for each a € A® the commu-
tator [D,a] is densely defined and bounded. Additionally put Hn = AXE, let Py denote
the orthogonal projection on Hn and assume that each P, commutes with D. Then
each (A®,Hn,D\,,) is a spectral triple satisfying the conditions of Theorem 3.2.18,
st natural compatible CQG morphisms tmn : QISOT(A®,Hm;D|tHm)
QISO* (AX, Hn; Di,,) (n,m € IN,m <n) and

 

there e

 

 

 

 

QISO*(A®, H, D) = lim QISO* (ARS, Hn, Dirta):

 

Similar conclusions hold if we replace everywhere above QISO* by QISO*.

 

Proof: We prove the assertion corresponding to QISO* only, since the proof for
QISO* follows by very similar arguments. Let us denote QISOT(A®,Hn, Dn) by
S,, and the corresponding unitary representation (in H,) by U,. Let us denote the
category of compact quantum groups acting by orientation preserving isometries on
(AS, Hn, Dl x,,) and (A®~,H, D) respectively by Qn and Q.
