37 Rieffel deformation

 

Now, by defining
llall,, = ||Lall ,

we have a pre-C* norm ||||; on A® endowed with the new product x J.

The completion of this pre C* algebra is the deformed C* algebra and is denoted by
Aj.

One has a natural Frechet topology on A, given by a family of seminorms {|||l,,_7}

where |lal|,.7 = Dyai<n Hee fedl

We recall the following Proposition from [46].

Proposition 1.3.6. ( Proposition 4.10, [46] ) Let J be fixed. Then for large enough k

there is a constant cy, such that for alla in A®, we have

 

 

ally < cr

Proposition 1.3.7. ( Proposition 7.1, [46] ) Let a be an action of V on the C* algebra
A, with A® its subalgebra of smooth vectors. Let J be a skew-symmetric operator on
V, and let a also denote the corresponding action of V on Aj. Then the subalgebra of

smooth vectors in Ay for a is exactly A. Moreover, (Az)_7 = A.
Corollary 1.3.8. A® and Af coincide as topological ( Frechet ) spaces.

Proof : The proof is essentially contained in the proof of Proposition 7.1 in [46] (
Proposition 1.3.7 above ). By Proposition 1.3.6, we know that there is a constant cy,

such that for any a in A® and for any ju,

|XMal]y < cx ||XMallon Sc

 

lall;

for j = |u|+2k and a new constant ¢,. Thus, the inclusion of A into A} is continuous

for their Frechet topologies. Similarly, using (Az)_, =A, we deduce that the inclusion

 

 

 

 

of AF into A® is continuous. This proves the result.

Examples

The Noncommutative Torus

Let A= C(T"). For v = (v1, v2,...,Un) in R", & = (21, 22,...,an) in T”, f in C(T”),
the action a of R” on A is given by ayf(x) = f(x1e(v1), r2e(v2),...ane(Un)). Let 0
be an X n skew symmetric matrix and J = g. Then A,; can be seen to be equal to
the noncommutative n tori Tj, that is the universal C* algebra generated by unitaries
U;, i = 1,2,...,n satisfying UjU; = e(6;;)U;Ui where 6; denotes the (i,j) th entry of
the matrix 6. We will denote 1 by the notation Ag.
