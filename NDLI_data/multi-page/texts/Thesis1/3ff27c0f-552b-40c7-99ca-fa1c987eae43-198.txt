Chapter 5: Quantum isometry groups of the Podles spheres 186

 

Corollary 5.4.17. The subcategory of Q'(D) consisting of objects (O,U) where ay is

a C* action does not have a universal object.

Proof: By Theorem 5.4.16, the proof will be complete if we can show that if a
universal object exists for the subcategory (say Q‘,) mentioned above, then it must
be isomorphic w: with QISO+(D (D). For a consider the quantum subgroups 3 n, N=
Ly 2st QISO+(D ) generated by rn =1,...,N and y. Let my : QISO+(D) — On
be the CQG morphism given by my(y) = y, tn(r;) = rf for n < N and my(r7) = 1
forn > N.

We claim that (On, Un := (id @ tn) 0 V) is an object in Q) ( where V denotes the
unitary representation of Q[SO*+(D) on H ). To see this, we first note that for all N,
Gdemv)o() = Deo APh ® ar {A4(1 + ripyrt*) 4 At riyrt*)}4 Zine AQn ®
a5 {Az (l—rityrg*) +A + rp grin )} + Drew APn ® a {A¥(L+y) +A y)h+
41 AQn @ HH {A¥(L— y) +A-(1 + y)}-

Among the four summands, the first two clearly belong to A @ On. Moreover, the
sum of the third and the fourth summand equals A(1 — a Pn) ® ae +(1 +y)+
A-(1-y)} + AQ - ee Qn) ® y-{A4(1 — y) + A-(1 + y)} which is an clement of
A® On.

We proceed similarly in the case of B, to note that it is enough to show that for all
N,

belongs to A ® On. The norm of the second and the fourth term can be eas-
ily seen to be finite. The first term equals $B(1 — yy Pn)[(A — A? + cl)? +
1
(A- A? +cl)~ GEA ~(3=A)” +cI}’] ® 1 and therefore belongs to A@ Qn. The
third term can be treated similarly.
Thus, there is surjective CQG morphism wy from the universal object, say G. , of
Q', to On. Clearly, (On) ws1 form an inductive system of objects in Q’(D), with the

 

inductive limit being QISO+(D), and the morphisms wy induce a surjective CQG
morphism (say w) from G to QISO+(D). But G is an object in Q’(D), so must be a
quantum subgroup of the universal object in this category, that is, QISO+ (D). This
gives the CQG morphism from QISO+ (D) onto G , which is obviously the inverse of ~,

 

 

 

and hence we get the desired isomorphism between G and QISO*(D).
