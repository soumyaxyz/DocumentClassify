183 The spectral triple by Chakraborty and Pal on SF as c>0

 

This implies

rir, =t_rk* for all n. (5.4.20)

Moreover, taking * on ( 5.4.18 ) and ( 5.4.19 ) respectively, we get the following:

roe — rant =0 foralln>1. (5.4.21)
rit art —r7_yra* =0 for alln>1. (5.4.22)

Thus, the equations ( 5.4.7 ) - (5.4.10 ) in Lemma 5.4.5 are satisfied with q*’s replaced
by r*’s and hence it is easy to see that there is a C*-homomorphism from S to 9
sending y,r;* to yo and q,* respectively, which is surjective by Proposition 5.4.8 and
is a CQG morphism by Lemma 5.4.9. In other words, (S. , Ao, V) is indeed a universal
object in Q’(D). It is clear that the maximal Woronowicz subalgebra of S§ for which
the action is faithful, that is QISO+(D), is generated by r¢_yrt*,n > land rt yr},
so again isomorphic with C*(Z2 * Z°).

This is summarized in the following:

Theorem 5.4.11. The universal object in the category Q’'(D), that is QISO*(D) exists
and is isomorphic with C*(Z2*Z©). Moreover, the quantum group QISO*(D) is again
isomorphic with C* (Zo * Z™).

Remark 5.4.12. This example shows that QISO* in general may not be matrix quan-
tum group, that is may not have a finite dimensional fundamental unitary, even if the
underlying spectral triple is of compact type. This is somewhat against the intuition
derived from the classical situation, since for a classical compact Riemannian manifold
the group of isometries is always a compact Lie group, hence has an embedding into the

group of orthogonal matrices of some finite dimension.

We end this chapter by noting that a gives an example where the quantum group
of orientation preserving isometries does not have a C* action. Before that, we recall

some useful properties of the so called Toeplitz algebra from [26].

Proposition 5.4.13. Let 7, be the unilateral shift operator on I?(IN) defined by T1(en) =
€n-1, N> 1, T(eo) = 0. Then the Toeplitz algebra C*(7). is the C* algebra generated
by 1, on 7 (IN). It contains all compact operators and moreover, the commutator of any

two elements of O* (71) is compact.
Let 7 be the operator on H defined by 7 = 7; ® id.
