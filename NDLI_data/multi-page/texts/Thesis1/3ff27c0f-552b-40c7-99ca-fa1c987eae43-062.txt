Chapter 1: Preliminaries 50

 

Now consider the quotient O* algebra Bo. = Cy([a,0o))/Co([a,oo)). Let for T in
B(H),7(TL) in Boo be the class of A > 7(T).

For any state w on the O* algebra Boo, T'r,(T) = w(7(T)) for all T in B(H) defines
a functional on B(H). As we are not going to need the choice of w in this thesis, we will

exists, then it agrees with the functional
Lim,_.9+. Moreover, Tr,,(T’) coincides ( upto a constant ) with the Dixmier trace ( see
chapter IV, [17] ) of the operator T|D|~? when the spectral triple has a finite dimension
p > 0, where |D|~” is to be interpreted as the inverse of the restriction of |D|? on the
closure of its range. In particular, this functional gives back the volume form for the
classical spectral triple on a compact Riemannian manifold.

Let 2*(A®) be the space of universal k-forms on the algebra A®% which is spanned
by aod(a1)---d(ax), a; belonging to A®, where 6 is as in Proposition 1.5.7. There
is a natural graded algebra structure on 2 = @yso Q*(A®), which also has a natu-
ral involution given by (d(a))* = —d(a*), and using the spectral triple, we get a *-
representation IIT : Q — B(H) which sends ag6(a1) «+ - 6(az) to agdp(a1)- +: dp(ax), where
dp(a) = [D,a]. Consider the state 7 on B(H) given by, T(X) = Lim;_.9+ me
where Lim is as above. Using 7, we define a positive semi definite sesquilinear form on
O*(A®) by setting (w,n) = 7(II(w)*I(n)). Let K* = {w € Q*(A%) : (w, w) = OF,
for k > 0, and K7! := (0). Let oF be the Hilbert space obtained by completing the
quotient 0*(A%°)/K* with respect to the inner product mentioned above, and we define
Hy = POE, where P;, denotes the projection onto the closed subspace generated by
6(K*-1). The map D! := d+ d* = dp + df on Hapae *= Brso Hi, has a self-adjoint
extension (which is again denoted by d+ d*). Clearly, He has a total set consisting
of elements of the form [apd(a1)---6(a,)], with a; in A® and where [w] denotes the
equivalence class Pi(w + K*) for w belonging to O*(A%°). There is a *representation
Ta+d* : A — B(Ha+ar), given by ta+a-(a)([a0d(a1)-+-5(ax)]) = [aaod(ar)--- 6(ax))-
Then it is easy to see that

Proposition 1.5.10. (A™®, Ha:a*,d+d*) is a spectral triple.

1.5.3 Laplacian in Noncommutative geometry

Now, we discuss the notion of Laplacian in noncommutative geometry as introduced
in [30]. Let (A®,H,D) be a spectral triple of compact type. To define the Laplacian
in the noncommutative case ( as in [30] ), we need the following assumptions on the
spectral triple.

Assumptions

1. (A®,H, D) is a compact type spectral triple.
