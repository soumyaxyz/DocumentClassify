satisfy the compatibility property:
Pm? Tnm = Pn Yam.

Thus, by the general properties of the C*-algebraic inductive limit, we have a unique
unital C*-homomorphism A,, : Sgo > Soo ® Soo Satisfying Ago ° Tn,oo = Pn for all n.
We claim that (Sx, Ax) is a CQG.

We first check that A,, is coassociative. It is enough to verify the coassociativity
on the dense set Un7n,oo(Sn). Indeed, for s = Tnjoo(a) (a € Sn), by using Aco © Trjoo =

(Tn,c0 ® Tn,co) 0 An, we have the following:

(Aco ® id) Ago (7n,00(@))
= (Ac @ id) (Tn,oo ® Tn, oo )(An(a))
(7,00 ® Tn,co ® Tn,co) (An ® id)(An(a))
(Tn,co ® Tn,co ® Tn,co) (id ® An)(An(a))
(Tn,co ® (Mn,co @ Mn,oo) 0 An)(An(a))
(Tn,co ® Aco © Tn,co)(An(a))
(id @ Ago) ((tn,00 ® noo) (An(a)))
(id ® Ago) (Aco (7n,oo (@)))
which proves the coassociativity.

Finally, we need to verify the quantum cancellation properties. Note that to show
that Ago (Soo) (1® Soo) is dense in Soo @Soo it is enough to show that the above assertion
is true with Soo replaced by a dense subalgebra U,, 7n,co(Sn)-

Using the density of A,(S,)(1 @S,) in S, ® S, and the contractivity of the map
Tn,oo We note that (too ® Tn,oo)(An(Sn)(1 ® Sn)) is dense in (7,00 ® Tn,oo)(Sn ® Sn).
This implies that (7,00 ® M,00)(An(Sn)) (1 Fn,oo(Sn)) is dense in Tp,00(Sn) ® Mn,c0 (Sn)
and hence Ago (7n,oo(Sn))(1 ® n,oo(Sn)) is dense in tn,oo(Sn) ® Tn,oo(Sn). The proof of
the claim now follows by noting that tnoo(Sn) = Tm,coFnym(Sn) C tm,oo(Sm) for any
m > n, along with the above observations. The right quantum cancellation property
can be shown in the same way.

The proof of the universality property is routine and hence omitted.

 

 

 

 

We note that the proof remains valid for any other indexing set for the net, not

necessarily IV.
