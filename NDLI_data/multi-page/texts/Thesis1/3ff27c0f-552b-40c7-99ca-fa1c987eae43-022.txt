For a two-sided norm closed ideal Z of a C* algebra A, the canonical quotient norm
on the Banach space A/T is in fact the unique C* norm making A/T into a C* algebra.

Here we prove two results which we are going to need later on.

Lemma 1.1.1. /30] LetC be a C* algebra and F be a nonempty collection of C*-ideals
( closed two-sided ideals ) of C. Then for any x in C, we have

super lle + || = lla + oll,

where Ip denotes the intersection of all I in F and ||x+1|| = inf{||x— yl] : y € I}

denotes the norm in C/I.

Proof : It is clear that sup;¢¢ ||« + J|| defines a norm on C/Ip, which is in fact a C*

norm since each of the quotient norms ||. + J|| is so. Thus the lemma follows from the

 

 

 

 

uniqueness of C* norm on the C* algebra C/Ip.

Lemma 1.1.2. Let C be a unital C* algebra and F be a nonempty collection of C*-
ideals (closed two-sided ideals) of C. Let Io denote the intersection of all I in F, and
let pr denote the map C/Ip 2x +Ip'ea4+I16€C/T forT inF. Denote by Q the set
{wopz,I € F, w state on C/T}, and let K be the weak-« closure of the convex hull
of QU(-Q). Then K coincides with the set of bounded linear functionals w on C/Lo
satisfying ||w|| = 1 and w(a* + Zo) = w(a + Zo).

Proof : We will use Lemma 1.1.1. Clearly, K is a weak-* compact, convex subset of
the unit ball (C/Zo)} of the dual of C/Zpo, satisfying —K = K. If K is strictly smaller
than the self-adjoint part of unit ball of the dual of C/Zo, we can find a state w on
C/Zo which is not in K. Considering the real Banach space X = (C/Zo)%,,, and using
standard separation theorems for real Banach spaces (for example, Theorem 3.4 of [49],

page 58), we can find a self-adjoint element x of C such that ||z + Zo|| = 1, and

sup w!(x+IZo) < w(# +p).

Let y belonging to R be such that sup,yex w'(a + Zo) < y < w(a@ +p). Fix0<€<
w(a+Zo)—y, and let Z be an element of F be such that ||a+Zo||—§ < ||a+Z|| < ||a+Zol].
Let ¢ be a state on C/T such that ||x + Z|| = |d(a +Z)|. Since « is self-adjoint, either
o(a +Z) or —¢(a + TZ) equals ||a + Z||, and ¢’ := +¢0 pr, where the sign is chosen so
