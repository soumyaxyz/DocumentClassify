Acknowledgements

I would like to start by expressing my deepest gratitudes to my supervisor Debashish
Goswami who introduced me to the theories of noncommutative geometry and compact
quantum groups and whose mere presence acted as a psychological support to an extent
unknown even to him. I thank each and every faculty member of Stat Math unit, ISI
Kolkata from each of whom I learnt something or the other. I am grateful to Prof.
Shuzhou Wang, whose valuable comments and suggestions helped me to have a better
understanding about the contents of this thesis and also led to an improvement of the
work. I thank the National Board for Higher Mathematics, India for providing me with
partial financial support. I should also mention the names of Max Planck Institute
fur Mathematics of Bonn and Chern Institute of mathematics of Nankai University for
allowing me to attend two workshop and conference on Non commutative Geometry
and Quantum Groups hosted by them, from where I had valuable exposures about the
subjects. I thank my parents, sister, aunt and uncle for their continuous support during
the time of working on this thesis. I would have been unable to fix some critical latex
problem unless my friend Rajat Subhra Hazra had spent his valuable time on it. I am
grateful to Biswarup for the discussions I had with him on operator algebras. Many
of my other friends including Koushik Saha, Abhijit da, Pusti da, Ashis da, Subhra,
Subhajit and obviously Rajat were a continuous source of encouragement. I thank
Subhajit for allowing me to use his room and providing me with a steady supply of 13
Tzameti et al. Lastly, I would like to mention the names of Subhra and Rajat again for

bearing with my bhoyonkor and haayre during a critical part of my thesis work.
