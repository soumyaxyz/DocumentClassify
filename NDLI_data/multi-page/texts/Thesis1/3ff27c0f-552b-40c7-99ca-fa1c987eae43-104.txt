then clear from the definition of Z that 7 induces a surjective CQG morphism (in fact,
a morphism in the category Q/,(d+d*)) x’: QISOf (d+ d*)/I > QISO*2.

Conversely, if V = (id ® pr) o Ua+a« is the representation of QISO} (d+ d*)/T on
Ha+a+ induced by Uayae (where pz : QISO7 (d+ d*) + QISOF (d+ d*)/T denotes the
quotient map), then V preserves HY, (by definition of Z), so commutes with Py. Since
V also commutes with (d+d*)?, it follows that V must commute with (d+d*)?Pp = L,
that is,

V(d"d Py @1) = (d*dPy @ LV.

It is easy to show from the above that ay (which is a C* action on A since QU 4,4 18 80
by assumption) is a smooth isometric action of QISO7 (d+ d*)/T in the sense of [30],
with respect to the Laplacian £. This implies that QISO7 (d+ d*)/T is a sub-object o
QL SO in the category Qe: and completes the proof.

 

 

 

 

Now we prove that under some further assumptions which are valid for classical
manifolds as well as their Rieffel deformation, one even has the isomorphism QS OfD =
QISOF (d+ d*).

We assume the following:

(A) Both the spectral triples (A®, H, D) and (A™®, Ha+ax, d+ d*) satisfy the
assumptions (1) — (7), so in particular both QISO*? and QISO*’ exist (here D! =
d+d*).

(B) For all a,b in A®, we have

(a, D)a49, = (a, 0, , (dpa, dpb) ra, = (dpa, dpb),

Remark 3.3.5. For classical compact spin manifolds these assumptions can be verified

by comparing the local expressions of D? and the ‘Hodge Laplacian’ (D')? in suitable

coordinate charts. In fact, in this case, both these operators turn out to be essentially

same, upto a ‘first order term’, which is relatively compact with respect to D? or (D')?.

By assumption (B), we observe that the identity map on A® extends to a unitary,
say ¥, from H9, to H9,,. Moreover, we have

Lp = DL,

from which we conclude the following:
Proposition 3.3.6. Under the above assumptions, QISOfL = QISOf»’.

We conclude this section with the following result, which identifies the quantum
isometry group QI, SOF? of [30] as the QI SOt of a spectral triple, and thus, in some

sense, accommodates the construction of [30] in the framework of the present article.
