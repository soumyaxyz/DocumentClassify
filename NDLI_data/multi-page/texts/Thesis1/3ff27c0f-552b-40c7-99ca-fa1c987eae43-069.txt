57 Computation of QISO*

 

where q belongs to QISO*, a; belongs to Ax, and for x in Ao, ( the *-subalgebra
generated by the eigenvectors of L ) we write in Sweedler notation a(x) = t) @ a) €

Ao ® (QISO*)o (a denotes the action of QISOF).

2.2 Computation of QISO*

Here we compute QISO® for three commutative examples, viz: the sphere, the circle
and the n tori. In Chapter 4, we will be able to compute it for two noncommutative

examples, namely Ag and Sj by using Theorem 4.4.7.

2.2.1 The commutative spheres

Let QISO® be the quantum isometry group of S? and let a be the action of QISO*
on C(S?). Let £ be the Laplacian on S? defined as
a? O 1 @&

= 002 + cot (9) — +

c 20" sin?(@) Ab?’

where the cartesian coordinates +1, £2, x3 for S? are given by x; = rcoswsin@, r2 =
* * * * - 2

rsinwsin6@, x3 =rcos@. In the cartesian coordinates, £ = yy 2.

The eigenspaces of £ on S? are of the form
Ey, = Sp{(e1.X1 + 2X2 + 3X3)" :qG €C,i=1,2,3, ve = 0},

where k > 1. Ey consists of harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree k on R®
restricted to $?( See [33], page 29-30 ).
We begin with the following lemma, which says that any smooth isometric action

by a quantum group must be ‘linear’.

Lemma 2.2.1. The action a satisfies a(x;) = Yaa x; ® Qiz where Qi; belongs to
QISO£,i = 1,2,3.

Proof : Since a is a smooth isometric action of QISO*% on C (S?), a has to preserve
the eigenspaces of the Laplacian £. In particular, it has to preserve E) = Sp{e1z1 +
cotg +0373 : G € C,i=1,2,3, ey Ce = 0}.

Now note that x, + iva, 1 — ive are in Fy, hence 21,22 are in Fy. Similarly x3

belongs to E; too. Therefore Ey = Sp{x1,22,x%3}, which completes the proof of the

 

 

 

lemma.

 

Now, we state and prove the main result of this section, which identifies QISO*
with the commutative C* algebra of continuous functions on the isometry group of S?,
that is O(3).
