59 Computation of QISO*

 

Now, by (2.2.2 ) - ( 2.2.4 ), we have
[Qiz, Qj] = (Qj, Qik],

hence

(Qik; Qji] = 0.

Therefore the entries of the matrix @ commute among themselves. However, by
faithfulness of the action of QISO*, it is clear that the C*-subalgebra generated by
entries of Q (which forms a quantum subgroup of QIS OF acting on C’ (S?) isometrically)
must be the same as QISO*, so QISO® is commutative.

So QISO* = C(G) for some compact group G acting by isometry on C(S?) and G is
clearly universal in the category of compact metrizable groups acting on S? isometrically,
so that G = O(3).

 

 

 

 

Remark 2.2.3. Similarly, it can be shown that QISO(S") is commutative for alln > 2.

2.2.2. The commutative one-torus

Let C = C(S") be the C*-algebra of continuous functions on the one-torus S!. Let
us denote by z and Z the identity function (which is the generator of C(S')) and its
conjugate respectively. The Laplacian coming from the standard Riemannian metric
is given by L(z”) = —n?z”, for n in Z, hence the eigenspace corresponding to the
eigenvalue —1 is spanned by z and Z. Thus, the action of a compact quantum group
acting smoothly and isometrically (and faithfully) on C(S1) must be linear in the sense
that its action must map z into an element of the form z@ A+Z@ B. However, we show
below that this forces the quantum group to be commutative as a C* algebra, that is it

must be the function algebra of some compact group .

Theorem 2.2.4. Let a be a faithful, smooth and linear action of a compact quantum
group (Q, A) on C(S!) defined by a(z) = z@A+Z@B. Then Q is a commutative C*
algebra.

Proof : By the assumption of faithfulness, it is clear that Q is generated (as a unital
C* algebra) by A and B. Moreover, recall that smoothness in particular means that
A and B must belong to the algebra Qo spanned by matrix elements of irreducible
representations of Q . Since zZ = Zz = 1 and a is a *-homomorphism, we have
a(z)a(Z) = a(Z)a(z) =1@1.

Comparing coefficients of z?,Z? and 1 in both hand sides of the relation a(z)a(Z) =
1@ 1, we get

AB* =BA*=0, AA*+ BBY =1., (2.2.5)
