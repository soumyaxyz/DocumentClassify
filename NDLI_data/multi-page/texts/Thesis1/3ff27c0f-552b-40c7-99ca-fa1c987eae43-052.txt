where s = —u,t = Ju—v, which by Proposition 1.3.1 equals h(xo(a)b) = h(ab). That

is, we have proved

(a,b) 7 = (a,b) Va,b € Qo, (1.3.10

where (-,-) and (-,-) respectively denote the inner products of L?(h;) and L?(h). We
now complete the proof of the lemma by extending ( 1.3.10 ) from Qo to O™, by using
the fact that Q© is a common subspace of the Hilbert spaces L?(h) and L?(h,) anc

moreover, Qo is dense in both these Hilbert spaces. In particular, taking a = 1 in Qo,

 

 

 

we have h = hy on O™.

 

Remark 1.3.11. Lemma 1.3.10 implies in particular that for every fixed a,,a2 in Qo,
the functional Qo 3 b> h(ai x7b x 7 a2) = h(bx7a2 x7 (fisarb fi)) (where fi is as
in Remark 1.2.20 ) = h(b(a2 x7 (fisaib fi))) extends to a bounded linear functional

on Q.

Let e be the identity of T?” and U;, be a sequence of neighbourhoods of e shrink-
ing to e, f, smooth, positive functions with support contained inside U,, such that
gen fn(z)dz = 1 for all n.

Let us denote the action of T?” action on A® induced by x by X. Define » fn(@) =
Spen X¥2(a) fn(z)dz. Then, we have the following result:

Lemma 1.3.12. Aj;,(a) belongs to O° and

Proof : We note that, by using the translation invariance of Haar measure, for

all g in T?”, XgAyp,(@)) = San fn(g-th)Xpn(a)dh. Therefore, Xg(Ap,(@)) — Ap, (a) =
Jyon(fn(g7 th) — fn(h))Xn(a)dh which proves the first part.
Now we prove the second part. As fyon fn(z) = 1 for all n and supp (fn) C Un, we
