Conversely, given U as in the statement of the converse part of the theorem, we
observe that for each x in X, by Theorem 3.2.3, (id ® evg)U = Uy,, for some wz such

3.2.2 Quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries of an R-
twisted spectral triple

In view of the characterization of orientation-preserving isometric action on a classical

manifold ( Theorem 3.2.4 ), we give the following definitions.

Definition 3.2.5. A quantum family of orientation preserving isometries for the (
odd, compact type ) spectral triple (A~,H,D) is given by a pair (S,U) where S is a
separable unital C*-algebra and U is a linear map from H toH®S such that U given by
U(€@b) =U(E)(1@b) (E inH, b in S ) extends to a unitary element of M(K(H) @8)
satisfying the following:

(i) for every state @ on S we have UsD = DUg, where Us := (id ® ¢)(U);

(ti) (id ®@ ¢) 0 ay (a) € (A®)” for all a in A® and state ¢ on S, where ay(x) :=
O(a ® 1)0* for x belonging to B(H).

In case the C*-algebra S has a coproduct A such that (S,A) is a compact quantum

group and U is a unitary representation of (S,A) on H, we say that (S,A) acts by
