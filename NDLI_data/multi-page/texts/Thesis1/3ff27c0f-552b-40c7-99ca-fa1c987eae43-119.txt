107 QISO* for zero dimensional manifolds

 

(where we identified A, with a subalgebra of An+1) and Sp, is generated exactly by these
coefficients of S,41 which appear in the image of A, under an+1. This in conjunction
with the previous lemma suggests the strategy for computing relevant quantum isometry
groups inductively. Suppose that we have determined the generators of S,. Then S,41
is generated by generators of S, and these of the QU4,., with the only additional
relations provided by the equation ( 3.5.1 ).

This will be used below to determine the concrete form of relations determining S;,
for the commutative AF algebras.

Before stating the next result, we fix some notations. Let An be a sequence of
commutative finite dimensional C* algebras as above. Let A, = C(X,) where X;, =
{x1,£2,...,Um}. Dualizing the embedding from A, to An+1, there is a surjective map,
say froin from Xp41 to X,. Let 1; denote the cardinality of the set {« € Xn41 :
fn+i1,n(x) = xj}. Thus the embedding of A, into An+1 is determined by the sequence
{lj : i = 1,2,...,m}. We note that the cardinality of Xn+1 equals 57", li. Moreover, a
basis of An41 is given by {ej,7, : ri € {1,2,...li}} where ej, is the indicator function
of an element y of X,41 such that fryin(y) = 2 and y is the r; th element in X;41

Lemma 3.5.5. Let A be a commutative AF algebra. Suppose that A, is isomorphic
to C™ and the embedding of Ay into An41 is given by a sequence (1;)@",. Let m! =
iL li. Suppose that the ‘copy’ of QUm in Sy is given by the family of projections
aij (1,9 € {1,...m} ) and that the ‘copy’ of Um in Sn41 is given by the family of
projections acir;)(js;) (5 € {1,-..,m}, ri © {1,---, li}, 87 © {1,--.,Uj}). Then the
formula ( 3.5.1 ) is equivalent to the following system of equalities:
