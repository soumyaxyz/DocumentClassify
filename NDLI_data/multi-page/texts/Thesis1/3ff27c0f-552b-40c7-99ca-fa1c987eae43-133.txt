121 Qi Ss OF of a Rieffel deformed noncommutative manifold

Proof : Let us first observe that

XF(u,w) (*)
= (QA Ju) @ id)A(id @ O( Jw)) A(z)
= (Ju) arr Q(Jw),

and similarly (,5)(y) = Q(—v) <yp Q(s).

Thus, we have

rOY
= [ (O(—Ju) <a> O( Jw))(OQ(—v) ay > 2(s))e(—u.v)e(w.s)dududwds
Jian

= | (Q(Ju’) <a> O(Jw))(Q(—v) ay > O(s))e(ul.v)e(w.s)duldudwds
Ran

= [.. I. XF uw) )X(w,s) (ye((u, w).(v, 8))d(u, w)d(w, 8),

 

which proves the claim.

 

 

Let us denote by 9; ( Q; ) the C* algebra obtained from o ( Q ) by the Rieffe
deformation w.r.t. the matrix J described above. We recall from subsection 1.3.1 that

 

the coproduct A on Qo ( Qo ) extends to a coproduct for the deformed algebra as well!

and (Q;, A) ( (97,4) ) is a compact quantum group.

4.3.1 Derivation of the result

In this subsection, our set up is as in section 4.1 so that we have spectral triples on A?

for each J.

Lemma 4.3.1. Suppose that (Q,U) belongs to Obj(Q(A,H,D)), and there exists a
unital *-subalgebra Ag C A which is norm dense in every Aj such that

gebra such that ay (Ao) C (Ao) ®@ Q, and Qo is the Hopf *-algebra obtained by matrix
coefficients of irreducible unitary (co)-representations of Q. Also, let Sy = span{as :
a € Ag, s € Soo}, Then we have the following:
