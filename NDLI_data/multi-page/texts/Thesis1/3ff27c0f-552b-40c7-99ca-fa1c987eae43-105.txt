Theorem 3.3.7. If in addition to the assumptions already made, the spectral triple (
of compact type ) (A®, Hp, D') also satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3.2.17, so that
QISOF (D’) has a C*-action, then we have the following isomorphism of CQG s:

QISO£® = QISO} (D') = QISO*”’.

Proof : By Proposition 3.3.2 we have that QISO*? is a sub-object of QISOF (D’) in
the category Q/,(D'). On the other hand, by Theorem 3.2.17 we have QISOf (D’) as a

sub-object of QI. SO» in the category Qa Combining these facts with the conclusion

 

 

 

of Proposition 3.3.6, we get the required isomorphism.

 

Remark 3.3.8. The assumptions, and hence the conclusions, of this section are valid
also for spectral triples obtained by Rieffel deformation of a classical spectral triple, to

be discussed in details in chapter 4.

3.4 Examples and computations

In this section we compute the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries for
spectral triples on SU,,(2) and C(T?). The computations for the Podles’ spheres and

Rieffel deformed manifolds are given in chapter 5 and Chapter 4 respectively.

3.4.1 Equivariant spectral triple on SU,,(2)

We recall from subsection 1.2.4 that by thy s, we will denote the (i,j) th matrix element
of the (2n+1) dimensional representation of SU,,(2) and ej; 8 will denote the normalized
( with respect to the Haar state h ) ¢?,s. We consider the spectral triple on SU,,(2)
constructed by Chakraborty and Pal ( [13] ) and also discussed thoroughly in [18] which
is defined by (A°°,H, D) where A°® is the linear span of t7, s, H = L?(SU,,(2)) and D

is defined by :

= (Qn+1eyj, n fi
= —(2n+ ley, n=i.

Here, we have a cyclic separating vector lgy,(2), and the corresponding faithful
state is the Haar state h. Thus, we are in the set up of the subsection 3.2.4, and as
€=1, Apo = A® in this case. Therefore, an operator commuting with D ( equivalently
with D ) must keep Vv; = Span{ti, 27 = lees 1} invariant for all fixed | and i where

D is the operator as in subsection 3.2.4.
