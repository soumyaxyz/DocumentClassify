Chapter 1: Preliminaries 48

 

Example 1.5.3. Let M be a smooth spin manifold. Then from Proposition 1.4.5, we
see that (C™(M),H, D ) is a spectral triple over C©(M) and is of compact type if M
is compact.

We recall that when the dimension of the manifold is even, A, = A} ® AZ. An L?
section s has a decomposition s = 8; + sq where s1(m),s2(m) belongs to A}(m) and
Az (m) (for all m ) respectively where A*(m) denotes the subspace of the fibre over m.
This decomposition of L?(S) induces a grading operator y on L?(S). It can be seen that

D anticommutes with y.

Example 1.5.4. This example comes from the classical Hilbert space of forms discussed
in subsection 1.5.2. One considers the self adjoint extension of the operator d+d* on
H = @cH*(M) which is again denoted by d + d*. C®(M) has a representation on
each H*(M) which gives a representation, say 7 on H. Then it can be seen that (
C™@(M),H,d+d* ) is a spectral triple and d+ d* is called the Hodge Dirac operator.
When M is compact, this spectral triple is of compact type.

Remark 1.5.5. Let us make it clear that by a ‘classical spectral triple’ we always mean
the spectral triple obtained by the Dirac operator on the spinors (so, in particular, man-
ifolds are assumed to be Riemannian spin manifolds), and not just any spectral triple

on the commutative algebra C®(M).

Example 1.5.6. The Noncommutative torus

We recall from subsection 1.1.1 that the noncommutative 2-torus Ag is the universal
C* algebra generated by two unitaries U and V satisfying UV = e2"°VU where 0 is a
number in [0, 1].

There are two derivations d, and dz on Ag obtained by extending linearly the rule:
d\(U) =U, d(V) =0,
d,(U) =0, do(V) =V.

Then d, and dz are well defined on the following dense *-subalgebra of Ag :

There is a unique faithful trace on Ag defined as follows:
7) QmnU™V") = ago.

Let H = L?(r)@L7(r) where L?(r) denotes the GNS Hilbert space of Ag with respect
a 0

to the state tr. We note that A3° is embedded as a subalgebra of B(H) by at 0
