subalgebra QISOt(D) must be SO, (3). In particular, the universal object in the sub-
category of CQG s acting by orientation preserving isometries and containing SO,,(3)

as a quantum subgroup exists.

 

Lemma 5.3.40. If QISO*(D) exists, its induced action on Se. ws

the state h on the subspace spanned by {1, A, B, B*, AB, AB*, A*, B?, BY}.

say ag, must preserve

Proof : Let Wo = C.1, Wi = Span{1, A, B, B*},

Ws = Span{1, A, B, B*, AB, AB*, A2, B?, BY}.

We note that the proof of Proposition 5.3.8 and the Lemmas preceding it do not
use the assumption that the action is volume preserving, so the proof of Proposition
5.3.8 goes through verbatim implying that ao keeps invariant the subspace spanned
by {1, A,B, B*} and hence it preserves Ws as well. Let Ws = Wi ® W’ be the
orthogonal decomposition w.r.t. the Haar state (say ho) of QISO*(D ). Since SO,(3)
is a sub-object of Q1SOt (D), there is a CQG morphism 7 from QISOt(D) onto SO,,(3)
satisfying (id®m)ao = A, where A is the SO,,(3) action on SP ee It follows from this that
any QISO* (D)-invariant subspace (in particular W’) is also SO,,(3)-invariant. On the
other hand, it is easily seen that on Ws , the SO,(3)-action decomposes as Wi aw",
(orthogonality w.r.t. h, the Haar state of SO,(3))), where W" is a five dimensional
irreducible subspace.

We claim that W! = W", which will prove that the Q1SO*(D)-action ag has the
same h-orthogonal decomposition as the SO,,(3)-action on Ws, so preserves C.1 and its
h-orthogonal complements. This will prove that ap preserves the Haar state h on w2.

We now prove the claim. We observe that V := W/()W" is invariant under the
SO,,(3)-action but due to the irreducibility of A on the vector space W! or W", it has
to be zero or W! = W". Now, dim(V) = 0 implies dim(W’) + dim(W”) =5+5>9=

dim(Ws:) which is a contradiction unless W! = W’.

Theorem 5.3.41. If QISO+(D) exists, then we have QISO*(D) = SO,(3). In par-
ticular, the universal object in the subcategory of Q'(D) with objects containing SO,,(3

as a sub- object, exists.

Proof : In Lemma 5.3.40, it was noted that Proposition 5.3.8 follows as before. We

observe that the other Lemmas used to prove Theorem 5.3.31 require the conclusion o:

 

 

 

Lemma 5.3.40 as the only extra ingredient.
