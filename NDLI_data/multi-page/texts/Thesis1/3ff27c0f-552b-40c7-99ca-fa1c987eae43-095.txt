83 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

Theorem 3.2.16. (i) For every state ¢ on G,

(id @ $) 0 ap(A®) belongs to A” () Dom(6").
n>1
(ii) If the spectral triple satisfies the Sobolev condition then A® (and hence A ) is

stable under ag.

Proof: Since Up commutes with D ® I, it is clear that the automorphism group
7, commutes with ag = (id ® ¢) o ap, and thus by the continuity of ap in the strong

operator topology it is easy to see that, for a in Dom(d),

= 6 $
lim T,(ap (a)) — a6 (a)
t0+ t
. Ti(a) —a
_ gi tt
= Bi 9
= a§(d(a)).

Thus, ag leaves Dom(6) invariant and commutes with 6. Proceeding similarly, we prove

 

 

 

 

(i). The assertion (ii) is a trivial consequence of (i) and the Sobolev condition.

Let us now assume

a. . —1tD?
(2) The spectral triple is ©-summable, that is, for every t > 0, e~'?

and the functional r(X) = Limo ( where Lim is as in subsection 1.5.2 ), isa
positive faithful trace on the * algebra, say S*, generated by {T, (A%), T.(A®)([D, al):
ace A}.

The functional 7 is to be interpreted as the volume form ( we refer to [29], [30] for
the details ). The completion of S® in the norm of B(H) is denoted by S, and we
shall denote by |lal]2 and || - ||. the L?-norm r(a*a)3 and the operator norm of B(H)
respectively.

From the definition of 7, it is also clear that T; preserves 7, so extends to a group of
unitaries on V := L?(S®,7). Moreover, for X such that [D, X] is in B(H), in particular

for X in S°, we have
