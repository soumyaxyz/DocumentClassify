105 QISO* for zero dimensional manifolds

 

Since U,, is a unitary which commutes with D, = D|y,, and hence preserves the
eigenspaces of Dn, it restricts to a unitary representation of S,, on each Hy, form <n.
In other words, (Sn, Un|t1) € Obj(Qm), and by the universality of S there exists a
compact quantum group morphism, say, Tm,n : Sm — Sp such that (id@amn)Um|Hm =
Unlttm-

Let p < m < n. Then we have (id @ tmnpm)Up|n, = Unlu,- It follows by the
uniqueness of the map 7p,» that tpn = TmnTp,m, that is (Sp)new forms an inductive
system of compact quantum groups satisfying the assumptions of Lemma 1.2.25. Denote
by Soo the inductive limit CQG obtained in that lemma, with tpoo : Sn — S denoting
the corresponding CQG morphisms. The family of formulas U|y,,, := (id ® t,00) 0 Un
combine to define a unitary representation U of S. on H. It is also easy to see from
the construction that U commutes with D. This means that (S.,U) € Obj(Q), hence
there exists a unique surjective CQG morphism from S := QISO*(A®,H, D) to Sx
identifying S,, as a quantum subgroup of S.

The proof will now be complete if we can show that there is a surjective CQG
morphism in the reverse direction, identifying S as a quantum subgroup of S.. This
can be deduced from Lemma 1.2.25 by using the universality property of the inductive
limit. Indeed, for each n € IN the unitary representation, say V;,, of QISO*(A®, H, D)
restricts to Hy, and commutes with D on that subspace, thus inducing a CQG morphism
Pn from S, = QISOT(A®, Hn, Dn) into S. The family of morphisms (pn)nem satisfies
the compatibility conditions required in Lemma 1.2.25. It remains to show that the
induced CQG morphism go from Soo into S is surjective. By the faithfulness of the
representation V of QISO*(A®,H,D), we know that the span of matrix elements
corresponding to all V,, forms a norm-dense subset of S. As the range of p,, contains the

matrix elements corresponding to V, = V|7,,, the proof of surjectivity of poo is finished.

 

 

 

The assumptions of the theorem might seem very restrictive. In the next section

 

however we will describe a natural family of spectral triples on AF-algebras, constructec

in [16], for which we have exactly the situation as above.

3.5.2 Quantum isometry groups for spectral triples on AF algebras

We first recall the construction of natural spectral triples on AF algebras due to
E. Christensen and C. Ivan ( [16] ). Let A be a unital AF C*-algebra, the norm closure
of an increasing sequence (A,)nemw of finite dimensional C*-algebras. We always put
Ao = Clu, A® = UP, An and assume that the unit in each A, is the unit of A.
Suppose that A is acting on a Hilbert space H and that € € H is a separating and

cyclic unit vector for A. Let P, denote the orthogonal projection onto the subspace
