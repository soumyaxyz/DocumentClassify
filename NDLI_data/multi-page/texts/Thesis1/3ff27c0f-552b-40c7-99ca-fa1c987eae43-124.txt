Chapter 4: Quantum isometry groups for Rieffel deformed manifolds 112

 

a, [D,a] belong to Dom(=) (where & is the generator of T/), and &({D,a]) = [D, &(a)|
belongs to B(H).
Using this, we obtain

\|Z{((D, a}) — (D,a]|| = [t “(E([D,a]))ds < t||=((D, 4).

The required strong continuity follows from this. Then applying Proposition 1.3.5 to

 

 

 

the C* algebra A, and the action 3, we deduce that 7 7(X) is a bounded operator.

 

Lemma 4.1.4. For each J, (AS, 73,H, D) is a spectral triple, that is, [D, 7 (a)] belongs
to B(H) for all a in AS.

Proof: [D,73(a)|(s)=Df f Bsu(a )Bv (s)e(u.v)dudv — ff Byu(a) )B,(Ds)e(u.v)dudv.
Using ( 1.3.1 ) and closability of D, we have
Df f Biu(a)By(s)e(u.v)dudv =f f D(Bsu(a)By(s))e(u.v)dudo.

As D commutes with V, the above expression equals

J [ PGnlaiis)eturyduao— ff By.(a)DB,(s)e(u.e)dude.

So we have
[D,m7(a)](s) = J [P-brka)iBe(s)e(ue)dude

= ff vale. alV5, -13,(s) (s)e(u.v)dudv
= ,({D,a)),

 

 

 

which is a bounded operator by Lemma 4.1.3.

 

4.2 Some preparatory results

In this section, we prove some preparatory results which will be needed in the next two
sections. Let T”, T", B, By be as in the previous subsection. By abuse of notation,
we will use the symbols 3 and B for the corresponding comodule maps also. Let y*, y«
be the canonical maps induced by y from C(T") > C(T") and Lie(T”) — Lie(T”)
respectively. Moreover, from now on, we will identify AS with 7 ;(A™) and often write
mo(a) simply as a.
