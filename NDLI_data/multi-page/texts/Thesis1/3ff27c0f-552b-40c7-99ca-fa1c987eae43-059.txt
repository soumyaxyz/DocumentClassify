1.5 Noncommutative Geometry

In this section, we recall those basic concepts of noncommutative geometry which we

are going to need. We refer to [17], [40], [22] for more details.

1.5.1 Spectral triples

Motivated by the facts in Proposition 1.4.5, Alain Connes defined his formulation of

noncommutative manifold based on the idea of a spectral triple:

Definition 1.5.1. A spectral triple or spectral data is a triple (A~,H, D) where H
is a separable Hilbert space, A® is a* subalgebra of B(H), ( not necessarily norm closed
) and D is a self adjoint ( typically unbounded ) operator such that for all a in A®,
the operator [D,a] has a bounded extension. Such a spectral triple is also called an odd
spectral triple. If in addition, we have y in B(H) satisfying y = y* = y~!, Dy = —yD
and [a, y| = 0 for alla in A™, then we say that the quadruplet (A~,H,D,7) is an even
spectral triple. The operator D is called the Dirac operator corresponding to the spectral

triple.

Furthermore, given an abstract *-algebra B, an odd ( even ) spectral triple on B is
an odd ( even ) spectral triple ( 7(B),H,D ) ( respectively, ( 7(B),H,D,y7 ) ) where
a: B — B(H) is a x-homomorphism.

Since in the classical case, the Dirac operator has compact resolvent if the manifold
is compact, we say that the spectral triple is of compact type if A® is unital and D

has compact resolvent.

Definition 1.5.2. We say that two spectral triples (™(A),H1, D1 ) and (79(A), H2, Do
) are said to be unitarily equivalent if there is a unitary operator U : Hy + Hz such
that Dz = UD,U* and 7(.) = Um (.)U* where 1;,j =1,2 are the representations of A

in Hj, respectively.

Next, we will give two examples of spectral triples in classical geometry and a non-

classical example. We will give more examples in chapters 3 and 5.
