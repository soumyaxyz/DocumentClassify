(2)fola=ea(f), luea=en(a);

(3) f* > a= feKa(a)* (equivalently f > a* = Ky(f)* >a)

for all f, fi, fg in U and a,aj, ag in A.

Similarly, a right action of a Hopf *-algebra ( U,Au,«u,ey ) on another Hopf *-
algebra (A, Au,«.4,€, ) is a bilinear form «: Ax U — C if the following conditions
hold: ayag<f = (a1<f(1))(a2<f(2)), a<( fife) = Aa(a)<(fi@ fo), Las f = eu(f), aly =
e4(a),a<f* = Ka4(a)* <f ( equivalently a* < f = a<Ky(f)*) for all f, fi, fo in U and
@,@1,@2 in A.

U = A’ gives a particular case of this duality pairing.

1.2.2. Compact Quantum Groups: basic definitions and examples

Definition 1.2.10. A compact quantum group (to be abbreviated as CQG from
now on) is given by a pair (S,A), where S is a unital separable C* algebra equipped
with a unital C*-homomorphism A: S + S @S (where ® denotes the injective tensor
product) satisfying

(ai) (A @id) oA = (id @ A) oA (co-associativity), and

(aii) each of the linear spans of A(S)(S@1) and of A(S)(1@S) are norm-dense inS@S.

It is well-known (see [67], [66]) that there is a canonical dense *-subalgebra So of S,
consisting of the matrix elements of the finite dimensional unitary (co)-representations
(to be defined shortly) of S, and maps € : Sg > C (co-unit) and « : So — So (antipode)
defined on Sp which make Sp a Hopf *-algebra.

The following theorem is the analogue of Gelfand Naimark duality for commutative

CQG s.

Proposition 1.2.11. Let G be a compact group. Let C(G) be the algebra of continuous
functions on G. If we define A by A(f)(g,h) = f(g-h) for f in C(G), g,h in G, then
this defines a CQG structure on C(G).

Conversely, let (S, A) be a commutative CQG. Let H(S) denote the Gelfand spec-
trum of S and endow it with the product structure given by xx’ = (x@x‘)A where x, x!
are in H(S). Then H(S) is a compact group.

Remark 1.2.12. In [57], A Van Daele removed Woronowicz’s separability assumption

(in [67] ) for the C* algebra of the underlying compact quantum group. We remark
