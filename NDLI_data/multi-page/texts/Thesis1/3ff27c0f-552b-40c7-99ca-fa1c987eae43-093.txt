81 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

on the linear span of {uli >0, j,& > 1}, and hence on the whole of /. This implies
that A maps Zp = Ker(zz,) into Ker(rz, ® 7z,) = (Ip @1+1@Zo) CU SU. In other
words, Zo is a Hopf C*-ideal, and hence G =U/Tp has the canonical compact quantum
group structure as a quantum subgroup of U/. It is clear from the relation (3.2.1) that
Ao coincides with the canonical coproduct of the quantum subgroup U/Zp inherited
from that of U. It is also easy to see that the object G. ,Ao,0z,) is universal in the
category Q’p, using the fact that (by Lemma 3.2.12) any compact quantum group (S,U)
acting by volume and orientation preserving isometries on the given spectral triple is
isomorphic with a quantum subgroup U//Z, for some Hopf C*-ideal Z of U.

Finally, the faithfulness of Up follows from the universality by standard arguments
which we briefly sketch. If G, C G is a *-subalgebra of G such that UW is an element o
M(K(H) ® G1), it is easy to see that (G1, Up) is also an object in Or, and by definition
of universality of G it follows that there is a unique morphism, say j, from G to G,. Bu

the map io j is a morphism from G to itself, where 7: G, > G is the inclusion. Again

 

 

by universality, we have that io 7 = idg, so in particular, 7 is onto, that is,. G; = G.

 

Consider the *-homomorphism ag := ay,, where (G,U) is the universal objec

 

obtained in the previous theorem. For every state @ on G. , (id ® ¢) 0 ag maps A into
A”. However, in general ag may not be faithful even if Up is so, and let G denote the
C*-subalgebra of G generated by the elements {(f @ id) oag(a): f € A*,a€ A}.

Remark 3.2.14. If the spectral triple is even, then all the proofs above go through with

obvious modifications.

Definition 3.2.15. We shall callG the quantum group of orientation-preserving isome-
tries of R-twisted spectral triple (A®,H, D, R) and denote it by QISOZ(A®,H, D, R)
or even simply as QISO} (D). The quantum group G is denoted by QISO* (D).

If the spectral triple is even, then we will denote G and G by QISOR(D,7) and

QISO}(D,7) respectively.
