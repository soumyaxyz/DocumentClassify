3.3. Comparison with the approach of [30] based on Lapla-

cian

Throughout this section, we shall assume the set-up of subsection 3.2.3 for the existence
of a ‘Laplacian’, including assumptions 1 — 6. Let us also use the notation of that
subsection.

We recall from chapter 2 that a CQG (S,A) which has an action a on A is said
to act smoothly and isometrically on the noncommutative manifold ( of compact type
) (A®,H, D) if (id ® d) o a( AZ?) C AZ? for every state ¢ on S, and also (id @ ¢) oa
commutes with the Laplacian £ = Lp on Aj? ( where A>° is the complex linear span
of the eigenvectors of £ ). One can consider the category Q/. p of all compact quantum
groups acting smoothly and isometrically on A, where the morphisms are quantum
group morphisms which intertwin the actions on A. We make the following additional

assumption throughout the present section:

(7) There exists a universal object in Q/,,, ( the quantum isometry group for the
Laplacian £ = Lp in the sense of [30]), and it is denoted by QISO* = QISO*?

The following result now follows immediately from Theorem 3.2.17 of subsection 2.3.
Corollary 3.3.1. If (A~,H,D) is a spectral triple ( of compact type ) satisfying any

of the two conditions (a) or (b ) of Theorem 3.2.17, then QISO}(D) is a sub-object
of QISOfL in the category QQ:

Proof: The proof is a consequence of the fact that QISO7 (D) has the C*-action ao

on A, and the observation already made in the proof of the Theorem 3.2.17 that this

 

 

 

action commutes with the Laplacian Lp.

 

Now, we will need the Hilbert space of forms 7(g4q* corresponding to a @-summable
spectral triple (A®%,H, D) as discussed in subsection 1.5.2. We recall that one obtains
an associated spectral triple (A™®, Ha+a«,d+d*). We assume that this spectral triple is
of compact type, that is, d+ d* has compact resolvents.

We will denote the inner product on the space of k forms coming from the spectral
triples (A®, H, D) and (A®, Ha+a-, d+ d*) by (, v4, and (, rth ae respectively,
k=0,1.

We will denote by 7p, 7a+a* the representations of A® in H and Ha+a* respectively.

Let Ugya« be the canonical unitary representation of QISO} (d+ d*) on Haar.

Ha+a« breaks up into finite dimensional orthogonal subspaces corresponding to the
distinct eigenvalues of A := (d+d*)? = d*d+dd*. It is easy to see that A leaves each of

the subspaces 7p invariant, and we will denote by V),; the subspace of 11), j. spanned
