3.2.4 Universal object in the categories Q or Q’

We shall now investigate further conditions on the spectral triple which will ensure the
existence of a universal object in the category Q or Q’. Whenever such a universal
object exists we shall denote it by QISO+ (D), and denote by QISOt(D) its largest
Woronowicz subalgebra for which ay on A® (where U is the unitary representation of
QISO+(D) on H) is faithful.

 

 

Remark 3.2.21. If QISO+(D) exists, then by Proposition 3.2.7, there will exist some
R such that QISO*+(D) is an object in the category Q'p(D). Since the universal object

in this category, that is, QISO}(D), is clearly a sub-object of QISO+(D), we have
QISO*(D) © QISO}(D) for this choice of R.

 

Let us state and prove a result below, which gives some sufficient conditions for the
existence of QISO*(D).

 

Theorem 3.2.22. Let (A®,H,D) be a spectral triple of compact type as before and
assume that D has an one-dimensional eigenspace spanned by a unit vector €, which is
cyclic and separating for the algebra A®. Moreover, assume that each eigenvector of
D belongs to the dense subspace AE of H. Then there is a universal object, G, Uo).
Moreover, G has a coproduct Ap such that G, Ao) is a compact quantum group and
G, Ao, Up) is a universal object in the category Q’.

If we denote by G the Woronowicz C* subalgebra of G generated by elements of the
form (ay(a)(n ® 1), 7 ® 1g where n,n! are in H, a in A® and (. , dg denotes the G
valued inner product of H@G, we have G=G*C(T).

Proof: Let Vj, {e;;} be as before, and by assumption we have e;; = 2; for a unique

xij in A®. Clearly, since € is separating, the vectors {@j = «7,€,j = 1,...,di} are

 

linearly independent, so the matrix Q; = (((@%, Ge) Feat is positive and invertible.
Now, given a quantum family of orientation-preserving isometries (S,U), we must have
U(E @1) =€@q, say, for some q in S, and from the unitarity of U it follows that qisa
unitary element. Moreover, U leaves V; invariant, so let U (ei; @ 1) = Oy ez @ of But

this can be rewritten as
ay (iz )(E @ q) = Ling @ of).

Since € is separating and q is unitary, this implies ay (aj) = >>), viz ® oa", and thus

we have

O (Gq ® 1) = ay(wiy)"(EO@) = >_ ah,€ B av))*a = >_ Gee @ auf)".
