Chapter 1: Preliminaries 32

 

(bii) the linear span of a(B)(1 @ S) is norm-dense in B® S.

It is known ( see, for example, [60] , [44] ) that (bii) is equivalent to the existence
of a norm-dense, unital *-subalgebra Bo of B such that a(Bo) C Bo @alg So and on Bo,
(id ®e)oa=id.

We shall sometimes say that a is a ‘topological’ or C* action to distinguish it from

a normal action of von Neumann algebraic quantum group.

Definition 1.2.30. Let (S,a) has a C* action a on the C* algebra B. We say that the
action a is faithful if there is no proper Woronowicz C*-subalgebra S, of S such that
a is a C* action of S; on B.

Definition 1.2.31. Let (S,a) has a C* action a on the C* algebra B. A continuous

linear functional @ on B is said to be invariant under a if

(¢ ® id)a(b) = g(b).1s.

Now, we recall the work of Shuzhou Wang done in [60]. One can also see [4], [5].
The quantum permutation group Ql/, is defined to be the C* algebra generated

by aij (i,j =1,2,...n ) satisfying the following relations:

Yo aij = = 1,2 n
jal
n
Seay =1 §=1,2,..n
i=1

The name comes from the fact that the universal commutative C* algebra generated
by the above set of relations is isomorphic to C(S,) where S;, denotes the permutation
group on n symbols.

Let us consider the category with objects as compact groups acting on on a n-point
set X, = {21,29,..., Un}. If two groups G; and Gy have actions a; and ag respectively,
then a morphism from G to G2 is a group homomorphism ¢ such that a2(¢ x id) = ay.
Then C(S,,) is the universal object in this category. It is proved in [60] that the quantum
permutation group enjoys a similar property.

We have that C(Xn) = C*{e; : e? =e; = ef, Why er = 1,0 = 1,2,...,n}. Then

QU, has a C* action on C(X,,) via the formula:

n

a(e;) = ei @ ay, j =1,2,...n.
