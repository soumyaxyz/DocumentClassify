113 Some preparatory results

 

2a. Let (Q, A) be a CQG and Q a Woronowicz C* subalgebra of oO. Let there exist
unital *-subalgebra Ap C A, which is norm dense in every A,z, such that a is an action
: a(mo(Ao)) © m0(Ao) ® Qo. Let So be a vector subspace of H ( not necessarily closed )
such that there is a map @ : Sp — Sp @aig Qo making it into an algebraic Qo co module.
Moreover, (id ® 75) = B.

2b. C(T”) is a quantum subgroup of Q, the quotient map being denoted by WH:

2c. a(as) = a(a)a(s) for a in Ao, s in Sp. -

We recall that we shall denote by 7 the canonical homomorphism from R” to T” given
by (a1, 2, .++,@n) = (e(#1), (#2), --.--,€(@n)). Moreover, we define Q(w) := eve(4)°7Q,
Qu) = €Ve(u) 0G, for u in R”, where eve (respectively evg ) denotes the state on
C(T”) ( respectively, on C(T”) ) obtained by evaluation of a function at the point x
(respectively &).

We now make some observations.

Lemma 4.2.1. 1. From assumption 2c., it follows that adg = a.
Ds (id ® me)ad(a) = adj.
3. By = (id ® O(x))a.
4. Be = (id ® O(a) )a.
5. (q*)7} omg is a surjective C* homomorphism from Q to C(T") identifying C(T”)

as a quantum subgroup of Q.

Proof : By using ( 1.2.1 ), we have

adg(a)s
= a(a@idja-'(s)
= G(a@ id)(s() ® K(s(2))
(as) @ K(s(2))
(a)@(s(1)) ® K(s(2))
