Chapter 1: Preliminaries 42

 

Therefore, one has II;(b*)is(b) = 0, and hence i7(b*b) = i7(Ayz, (a)) = 0. It thus follows
that I(i(A,,(a))) = 0, which implies i(A;,(a)) = 0. But the faithfulness of h means
that 7 is one one, hence A;7,(a) = 0 for all n. Thus, recalling Lemma 1.3.12, we have

 

 

 

a= lino f, (a) = 0, which proves the faithfulness of h,.

At this point, we note a useful implication of the Lemma 1.3.10. Let us make use o

 

the identification of Qo as a common vector-subspace of all Q;. To be precise, we shal

sometimes denote this identification map from Qo to QF by py.

Corollary 1.3.14. Let W be a finite-dimensional (say, n-dimensional) unitary repre-
sentation of Q, with Ww belonging to M;(C)® Qo be the corresponding unitary. Then, for
any J, we have that Wy = (id@py)(W) is unitary in Q;, giving a unitary n-dimensional
representation of Q7. In other words, any finite dimensional unitary representation of

QO is also a unitary representation of Oy:

Proof:
Since the coalgebra structures of Q and Q 7 are identical, and Wy is identical with WwW
as a linear map, it is obvious that W, gives a nondegenerate representation of Q;.
Let y = (id ® h)(W3W,). It follows from the proof of Proposition 6.4 of [41] that y is
invertible positive element of M,, and (y2 @1l)Wy(y72 ®1) gives a unitary representation
of Q;. We claim that y = 1, which will complete the proof of the corollary. For
convenience, let us write W in the Sweedler notation: W = wi) ® wi). We note that

by Lemma 1.3.10, we have

(id @ h)(W3W,)
= waywayh(wey x 7 way)

= Wy wayh(w(a)wW2))
= (id@h)(W*W) = (id@h)(1@1)=1.

Example The Rieffel deformed orthogonal groups

Let 6 be an X n skew symmetric matrix. C(T”) sits inside C(O(n)) as a quantum
subgroup. It can be easily seen that Og(n) is obtained by Rieffel deformation from
C(O(n)) by using the induced R?” action as given in the equation ( 1.3.8 ) and consid-
ering the matrix J =—J®J when n is even and —J' ® J’ when n is odd where J and

J’ are the matrices introduced while giving the definition of the @ deformed spheres.
