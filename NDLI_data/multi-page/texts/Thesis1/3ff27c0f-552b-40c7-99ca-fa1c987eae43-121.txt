Quantum isometry groups for

Rieffel deformed manifolds

 

In this chapter, we give a general scheme for computing QISO£ and QIS OF by proving

 

that QISO*, ( respectively QIS' OF ) of a deformed noncommutative manifold coincides

with (under reasonable assumptions) a similar deformation of QI SOF, ( respectively
QL SO; ) of the original manifold.

 

4.1 Deformation of spectral triple

We recall from Chapter 1 the generalities of CQG s and Hopf algebras, in particular,
the dense unital Hopf *-subalgebra So of a CQG S generated by the matrix elements
of the irreducible unitary representations, the Sweedler convention for CQG action, as
well as the convolutions f<c, c> f and f og for functionals f,g on S and c in S.
Moreover, given an action y : B + B®S of the compact quantum group (S,A) on a
unital C*-algebra A, the dense, unital *-subalgebra of A on which 7 becomes an action
by the Hopf *-algebra So is going to be denoted by Apo.

A word of caution: The algebra Ap should not be confused with the Rieffel deformed
C* algebra A, in the case J = 0, for which we simply write A.

Let (S, As) be a compact quantum group. We also adopt the convention of calling
a vector space M an S co-module if it is an algebraic Sg co-module in the sense of
definition 1.2.13.

Before introducing the set up in which we are going to work, we prove the following

well known fact for the sake of completeness.

Proposition 4.1.1. Let E be a Banach space and G a second countable Lie group with

a strongly continuous action a on E such that ||ag(x)|| = ||a|| for all g in G and for all
