compact quantum groups (CQG for short) as the correct generalization of compact
topological groups.

The idea of a group acting on a space was extended to the idea of a CQG co-
acting on a noncommutative space (that is, a possibly noncommutative C* algebra ).
Following suggestions of Alain Connes, Shuzhou Wang in [60] defined and proved the
existence of quantum automorphism groups on finite dimensional C* algebras. Since
then, many interesting examples of such quantum groups, particularly the quantum per-
mutation groups of finite sets and finite graphs, were extensively studied by a number of
mathematicians (see for example [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [61] and references therein ). The
underlying basic principle of defining a quantum automorphism group corresponding
to some given mathematical structure (for example a finite set, a graph, a C* or von
Neumann algebra) consists of two steps: first, to identify (if possible) the group of auto-
morphism of the structure as a universal object in a suitable category, and then, try to
look for the universal object in a similar but bigger category, replacing groups by quan-
tum groups of appropriate type. However, most of the work done by them concerned
some kind of quantum automorphism group of a ‘finite’ structure, for example, of finite
sets or finite dimensional matrix algebras. It was thus quite natural to try to extend
these ideas to the ‘infinite’ or ‘continuous’ mathematical structures, for example classi-
cal and noncommutative manifolds. With this motivation, Goswami ( [30] ) formulated
and studied the quantum analogues of the group of Riemannian isometries called the
quantum isometry group. Classically, an isometry is characterized by the fact that its
action commutes with the Laplacian. Therefore, to define the quantum isometry group,
it is reasonable to consider a category of compact quantum groups which act on the
manifold (or more generally on a noncommutative manifold given by a spectral triple)
with the action commuting with the Laplacian, say £, coming from the spectral triple.
It is proven in [30] that a universal object in the category ( denoted by Q/, ) of such
quantum groups does exist (denoted by QI SO*) if one makes some mild assumptions
on the spectral triple all of which are valid for a compact Riemannian spin manifold.
The work of this thesis starts with the computation of the quantum isometry group in
several commutative and noncommutative examples ( [6], [7]).

However, the formulation of quantum isometry groups in [30] had a major drawback
from the view point of noncommutative geometry, since it needed a ‘good’ Laplacian to
exist. In noncommutative geometry it is not always easy to verify such an assumption
about the Laplacian, and thus it would be more appropriate to have a formulation in
terms of the Dirac operator directly. This is what is done in [8] where the notion of
a quantum group analogue of the group of orientation preserving isometries was given
and its existence as the universal object in a suitable category was proved. Then, a

number of computations for this quantum group were done in [8], [9] and [10].
