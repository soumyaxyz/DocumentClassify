5.4 The spectral triple by Chakraborty and Pal on Bie c>
0

Now, we shall consider another class of spectral triples on the Podles spheres and show
that they give rise to completely different quantum groups of (orientation preserving)
isometries. Indeed, for these spectral triples, we have been able to prove the existence
of QISO* and identify it with the CQG C*(Zy * Z~) where Z° denotes countably
infinite copies of the group of integers.

In this section, we will work with c > 0.

5.4.1 The spectral triple

Let us describe the spectral triple on $7, introduced and studied in [14].

Let Hy =H = P(INU{0}), H =H, OH.

Let {en,n > 0} be the canonical orthonormal basis of H, = H— and N be the
operator defined on it by N(e,) = nen.

We recall the irreducible representations 74 and m_ : H+ — H4 as in [14].

 

T+ (A)en = AglPren, (5.4.1)
T+ (B)en = cx(n)2en—1, (5.4.2)

Then (S27, H, D) is a spectral triple.
We note that the eigenvalues of D are {n : n € Z} and eigenspace is spanned
by en ) corresponding to the positive eigenvalue n and ( en for the negative
