Lemma 2.2.11. :
Ap By = By Aix for alli a 4s k x l.

Proof : From Lemma 2.2.10, we have for all k £1, Aj, By— By Aix = AjrBu—ByAje.
We consider the case where i # j.

We have, Ran(Ay,By — By Ain) C Ran(Aje) + Ran(By) C Ran(By By + Ay, Ain) (
using the facts that Aj, and Bj; are normal partial isometries by Lemma 2.2.8 and 2.2.9
and also that Bi Bi and A*¥,Aj, are projections ).

Similarly, Ran(Aj,.By — ByAj,) C Ran(By By + Aj, Ajr)-

Let
T, = Ax By — By Aix, (2.2.33)
Te = AjpBy — BuAje, (2.2.34)
T3 = By, By + Aj Aix; (2.2.35)
Ty = By Bu + Aj, Aje- (2.2.36)

Hence, T, = To, RanT, C RanT3 , RanT) C RanT.

We claim that 7,73 = 0.

Then Ran(Z3) C Ker(T1).

But RanT C RanT3 will imply that RanT, C KerTy. Hence, Ran(T) C Ker(T1) =
Ran(T7)~ = Ran(Zi)~ But Ran(T2) C Ran(T1) which implies that Ran(T2) = 0 and
hence both T) and T; are zero. Thus, the proof of the lemma will be complete if we can
prove the claim.

T1T3 = (By Bu + Aj, Aje) (Bi By + Aj, Aix) (2.2.37)

 

= Bi BaBj By + Bi By Aj, Aix af Aj Ajx Bi Bit at Aj Age Ain Aik: (2.2.38)

From Lemma 2.2.6, we have for all i 4 j, By Bj = 0 implying Bi By =0as By isa
normal partial isometry.

Again, from Lemma 2.2.7 for all k 4 1, By Aj, = 0. Then Ajz is a normal partial
isometry implies that By A}, = 0 for all k #1.

Similarly, by taking adjoint of the relation BrAj, = 0 for all k £1 obtained from
Lemma 2.2.7, we have Aj Bi, =0.

From Lemma 2.2.6, we have Aj, Ajz = 0 for alli 4 j. Ajy, is a normal partial isometry
implies that Aj,A%, = 0 for alli ¥ j.

Using these, we note that 7,73 = 0 which proves the claim and hence the lemma.
