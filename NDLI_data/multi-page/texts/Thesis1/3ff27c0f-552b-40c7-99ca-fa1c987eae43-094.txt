3.2.3 Stability and topological action

In this subsection, we are going to use the notations as in subsection 3.2.2, in particular
G. ,G,Up, ag. It is not clear from the definition and construction of QI SOR(D) whether
the C* algebra A generated by A® is stable under ap in the sense that (id @ ¢) o ag
maps A into A for every ¢. Moreover, even if A is stable, the question remains whether
ag is a C*-action of the CQG QISO}(D). In chapter 5, subsection 5.4.2 we have given
an example of a spectral triple for which the +-homomorphism ap is not a C* action.
However, one can prove that ag is a C* action for a rather large class of spectral triples,
including the cases mentioned below.

(i) For any spectral triple for which there is a ‘reasonable’ Laplacian in the sense
of [30]. This includes all classical spectral triples as well as their Rieffel deformation
(with R =I).

(ii) Under the assumption that there is an eigenvalue of D with a one-dimensional
eigenspace spanned by a cyclic separating vector € such that any eigenvector of D
belongs to the span of A®€ and {a € A® : a€ is an eigenvector of D} is norm-dense

in A ( to be proved in subsection 3.2.4 ).

Now we prove the sufficiency of the condition (i).
We begin with a sufficient condition for stability of A under ao. Let (A®,H, D)

be a (compact type) spectral triple such that

(1) A® and {[D,a], a € A®} are contained in the domains of all powers of the deriva-
tions [D,-] and [|D],-].

We will denote by T the one parameter group of «automorphisms on B(H) given
by T;(S) = e*? Se" for all S in B(H) which is clearly continuous in SOT. We will
denote the generator of this group by 6. For X such that [D,X] is bounded, we have
6(X) = i[D, X] and hence

Let us say that the spectral triple satisfies the Sobolev condition if

A®* = A” () Dom(6").

Then we have the following result, which is a natural generalization of the classical
situation, where a measurable isometric action automatically becomes topological (in

fact smooth).
