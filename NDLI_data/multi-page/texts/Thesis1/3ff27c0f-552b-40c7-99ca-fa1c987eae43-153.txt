Quantum isometry groups of the

Podles spheres

In this chapter, we compute quantum group of orientation preserving isometries for
spectral triples on the Podles spheres Si es We do it for two different families of spectral
triples, one constructed by Dabrowski et al in [24] and the other by Chakraborty and
Pal in [14] for c > 0. We get completely different kinds of quantum group of orientation
preserving isometries for the two families; for the former, it is SO,,(3), whereas, for the
latter it is C*(Zp * Z°) where Z° denotes countably infinite copies of the group of

integers.

5.1 The Podles Spheres

The Podles spheres were discovered in [43]. We will also need the equivalent descriptions
of the Podles spheres as given in [24], [37] and [50]. Hence, we give the descriptions one

by one.

5.1.1 The original definition by Podles

Let c belongs to R. The Podles’ sphere Sie is the universal C* algebra generated by

elements e_1,€9,¢€1 such that :

e; =e_;, 1=-1,0,1,

i
(1+ p?)(e_1e1 + weye_1) + ep? = ((1 + 12) pe +1)f,
ege-1 — e_1€0 =(1- we,

(1+ p2)(e-1e1 — ere-1) + (1— peo? = (1— W?)eo,
