77 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

 

orientation-preserving isometries on the spectral triple.
In case the spectral triple is even with the grading operator y, a quantum family of
orientation preserving isometries (A~,H,D,y) will be defined exactly as above, with

the only extra condition being that U commutes with y.

From now on, we will mostly consider odd spectral triples. However let us remark
that in the even case, all the definitions and results obtained by us will go through with
some obvious modifications. We also remark that all our spectral triples are of compact
type.

Consider the category Q = Q(A®,H, D) = Q(D) with the object-class consist-
ing of all quantum families of orientation preserving isometries (S,U) of the given
spectral triple, and the set of morphisms Mor((S,U),(S’,U’)) being the set of unital
C*-homomorphisms ® : S — S’ satisfying (id ®@ @)(U) = U’. We also consider an-
other category Q’ = Q’(A®%, H, D) = Q’(D) whose objects are triplets (S, A, U), where
(S, A) is a compact quantum group acting by orientation preserving isometries on the
given spectral triple, with U being the corresponding unitary representation. The mor-
phisms are the homomorphisms of compact quantum groups which are also morphisms
of the underlying quantum families of orientation preserving isometries. The forgetful
functor F : Q’ > Q is clearly faithful, and we can view F'(Q’) as a subcategory of Q.

Unfortunately, in general Q’ or Q will not have a universal object. It is easily seen
by taking the standard example A® = M,(C), H = C", D = I. Any CQG having
a unitary representation on C” is an object of Q’(Mn(C),C",1). But by Proposition
1.2.34, there is no universal object in this category. However, the fact that comes to our
rescue is that a universal object exists in each of the subcategories which correspond to
the CQG actions preserving a given faithful functional on M,,.

On the other hand, given any equivariant spectral triple, it has been shown in [31]
that there is a (not necessarily unique) canonical faithful functional which is preserved
by the CQG action. For readers’ convenience, we state this result (in a form suitable to
us) briefly here. Before that, let us recall the definition of an R-twisted spectral data
from [31].

Definition 3.2.6. An R-twisted spectral data ( of compact type ) is given by a quadruplet
(A®,H, D, R) where

1. (A®,H,D ) is a spectral triple of compact type.

2. R a positive (possibly unbounded) invertible operator such that R commutes with
D.

3. For alls € R, the map a+ o,(a) := R-*aR® gives an automorphism of A® (not

necessarily *-preserving) satisfying SUPse[—n,n] ||Fs(@)|| < 00 for all positive integer n.

We shall also sometimes refer to (A®,H, D) as an R-twisted spectral triple.
