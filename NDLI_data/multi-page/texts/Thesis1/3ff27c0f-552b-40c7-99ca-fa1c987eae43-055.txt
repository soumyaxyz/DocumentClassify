1.4 Classical Riemannian geometry

In this section we recall some classical facts regarding manifolds which will be useful to

us later on.

1.4.1 Classical Hilbert space of forms

Let M be an n dimensional Riemannian manifold and Q*(M) ( k = 0,1,2,...n ) be
the space of smooth k-forms. Set *(M) = {0} for k > n. The de-Rham differential
d maps 2*(M) to Q*+1(M). Let 2 = Q(M) = &,0*(M). We will denote the Rieman-
nian volume element by dvol. We recall that the Hilbert space L?(M) is obtained by
completing the space {f € C2°(M)} with respect to the pre-inner product given by
(fis f2) = Sry fifedvol.

In an analogous way, one can construct a canonical Hilbert space of forms. The
Riemannian metric (. , .),,, ( for m in M ) on T;,M induces an inner product on the
vector space T*,M and hence also A*T* M, which will be again denoted by (., .),,-
This gives a natural pre-inner product on the space of compactly supported k-forms by
integrating the compactly supported smooth function m ++ (w(m),7(m)),,, over M. We
will denote the completion of this space by H*(M). Let H = @-H*"(M).

Then, one can view d : 2 — Q as an unbounded, densely defined operator ( again
denoted by d ) on the Hilbert space H with the domain . It can be verified that it is

closable.

1.4.2 Isometry groups of classical manifolds

Let M be a Riemannian manifold of dimension n. Then the collection of all isometries of
M has a natural group structure and is denoted by [SO(M). Let C and U be respectively
a compact and open subset of M and let W(C,U) = {h € ISO(M) : h.C C U}. The
compact open topology on 1SO(M) is the smallest topology on [SO(M) for which the
sets W(C,U) are open. It follows ( see [34] ) that under this topology, [SO(M) is a
closed locally compact topological group. Moreover, if M is compact, [SO(M) is also
compact.

We recall that the Laplacian £ on M is an unbounded densely defined self adjoint
operator —d*d on the space of zero forms H°(D) = L?(M,dvol) which has the local

expression

for f in C%°(M) and where g = ((gij)) is the Riemannian metric and g~! = ((g’)).

It is well known that on a compact manifold, the Laplacian has compact resolvents.
