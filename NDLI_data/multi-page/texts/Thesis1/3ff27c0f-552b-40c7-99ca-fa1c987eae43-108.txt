Using these observations, we conclude that © maps Span{t!, : 1 > 1/2} into itself.
So, in particular, Ker(h) = Span{V/ : i = —l,,,,1,1 > 1/2} is invariant under &
which ( along with ®(1) = 1 ) implies that ® preserves h.

3.3 4.

We proceed by induction. The induction hypothesis holds for |] = 3 since linearity
means that span {a,7*} is invariant under ® and hence Span {a*,7} is also invariant.
The case for | = 1 can be checked by inspection as in the proof of 2 = 3. Consider the
induction hypothesis that ® keeps Vs invariant for all k,i with k < 1. From the proof of
2 = 3 we also have for all 1 > 3, avr) Cc yi @ yee by using linearity only.
Thus, © leaves invariant the Hilbert O module (vi? evit )@Q, and is a unitary there
since ® is Haar-state preserving. Since © leaves invariant vin2 ® Q by the induction

hypothesis, it must keep its orthocomplement, V; * invariant as well.

4. => 3.
The fact that ® keeps Vv} invariant for / = 1/2 will imply that ® is linear. The proof

of Haar state preservation is exactly the same as in 2 > 3.

4>1.

That ® preserves the Haar state follows from arguments used in the proof of the
implication 2 > 3.. Since Apo = Span{ti, a 204.9 = heen 1}, and ® keeps each V!
invariant, it is obvious that ®(Ao9) C Aoo @alg Qo and ®D = (Deid)e.

 

 

 

By Lemma 3.4.1, we have identified the category C with the category of CQG having

 

C* actions on SU,,(2) satisfying condition 3. of Lemma 3.4.1. Let the universal object
of this category be denoted by (Q, T).

Then by linearity we can write:

T(a)=a@A+¥7 @B,

T(7*) =a ®C+7 @D.

Now we shall exploit the fact that Tis a +-homomorphism to get relations satisfied
by A, B,C, D where Q is generated as a C* algebra by the elements A, B,C, D.
