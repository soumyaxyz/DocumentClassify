61804(D) denotes the QI1SO}(D) valued inner product of H ® QISO}(D)
is defined to be the quantum group of orientation and volume preserving isometries of
the spectral triple (A®, H, D) and is denoted by QISO}(D). The next section explores
the conditions under which the action of this compact quantum group keeps the C*
algebra invariant and is a C* action. Moreover, we have given some sufficient conditions

under which the universal object in the bigger category Q’ exists which is denoted by

 

QISO*(D) and the corresponding Woronowicz C* subalgebra as above is denoted by
QISO*(D). After this, we compare this approach with the Laplacian-based approach
in [30]. We obtain the following results:

(1) Under some reasonable conditions, QISOf(D) is a sub-object of QISO*% in
the category Q/..

(2) QL SO® is isomorphic to a quantum subgroup of QI. SOF corresponding to the
Hodge Dirac operator coming from D.

(3 ) Moreover, under some conditions which are valid for compact spin manifolds,
QISO£ and the QI SOf of the Hodge Dirac operator are isomorphic.

The next section is on examples and computations. To begin with, the compact
quantum group U,,(2) is identified as the QISO* of SU,,(2) corresponding to the spectral
triple constructed by Chakraborty and Pal in [13]. Then we derive that QISO? for the
classical spectral triple on C(T?) is C(T?) itself. We end the chapter by showing that
QISO* of spectral triples associated with some approximately finite dimensional C*
algebras arise as the inductive limit of Q1SOt of the constituent finite dimensional
algebras. The results of this chapter are taken from [8] and [9].

Chapter 4 is about the QISO* and QI. SOF of a Rieffel deformed noncommutative
manifold. We first discuss the isospectral deformation of a spectral triple, followed by
the proof of some preparatory technical results which will be needed later. Then in the
final section we prove that QIS' Of and QISOF of a Rieffel deformed ( noncommutative
) manifold is a Rieffel deformation of the QI SOR and QISOF ( respectively ) of the
original ( undeformed ) manifold.

In chapter 5, we compute the quantum group of orientation preserving isometries
for two different families of spectral triples on the Podles spheres, one constructed by
Dabrowski et al in [24] and the other by Chakraborty and Pal in [14]. We start by
giving the different descriptions of the Podles spheres ( as in [43], [24], [37], and [50] )
and the formula for the Haar functional on it. Then we introduce the spectral triples
on the Podles spheres as in [24] and show that it is indeed SU,,(2) equivariant and R-
twisted ( for a suitable R ). After this, the compact quantum group SO,,(3) is defined
and its action on the Podles sphere is discussed. In the 3rd section, the computation
for identifying SO,,(3) as QI SOE for this spectral triple is given. In the 4th section,

the spectral triple defined in [14] is introduced and then the corresponding QISO*
