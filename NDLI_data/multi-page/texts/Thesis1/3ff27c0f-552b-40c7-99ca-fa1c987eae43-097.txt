85 Definition and existence of the quantum group of orientation-preserving isometries

 

with the group of unitaries Ti, hence with its generator 6 and also with the self adjoint
operator £ = (id)?.

On the other hand, it follows from the definition of G = QISO}(D) that (r @
id)(ao(X)) = 7(X)1g for all X in B(H), in particular for X belonging to S™, and thus
the map S* @aigG > (a®q) + ao(a)(1@q) extends to a G-linear unitary, denoted by W
(say), on the Hilbert G-module V.@G. Note that here we have used the fact( which that
for any ¢, (id @ ¢)(W)(S® @aig G) CN, since af(S”) C.N. The commutativity of as
with T for every ¢ clearly implies that W and Ts ® idg commute on NV ® G. Moreover,
ag maps H4, into itself, so W maps H%, ®G into itself, and hence (by unitarity of W) it
commutes with the projection Pp @ 1. It follows that as commutes with Po, and (since
it also commutes with L) commutes with L = Py£Pp as well.

Thus, ae preserves each of the (finite dimensional) eigenspaces of the Laplacian
L£, and so is a Hopf algebraic action on the subalgebra Ap spanned algebraically by
these eigenvectors. Moreover, the G-linear unitary W clearly restricts to a unitary
representation on each of the above eigenspaces. If we denote by ((qij))(,j) the G-valued
unitary matrix corresponding to one such particular eigenspace, then by Proposition
1.2.23, qij must belong to Go and we must have e(qj) = 6;; (Kronecker delta). This

implies (id@®e€)oag = id on each of the eigenspaces, hence on the norm-dense subalgebra

 

 

 

 

Apo of A, completing the proof of the fact that ag extends to a C* action on A.

Combining the above theorem with Theorem 3.2.16, we get the following immediate

corollary.

Corollary 3.2.18. [f the spectral triple satisfies the Sobolev condition mentioned before,
in addition to the assumptions 1 — 6, then QISO} (D) has a C*-action. In particular,
for a classical spectral triple, QISO} (D) has C*-action.

Remark 3.2.19. Let us remark here that in case the restriction of T on A® is normal,
that is, continuous with respect to the weak operator topology inherited from B(H), then
HY, will contain A", which is the closure of AX in the weak operator topology of B(H),

so the condition (a) of Theorem 3.2.17 (and hence its conclusion) holds.

Remark 3.2.20. In a private communication to us, Shuzhou Wang has kindly pointed
out that a possible alternative approach to the formulation of quantum group of isome-
tries may involve the category of CQG which has a C*-action on the underlying C*
algebra and a unitary representation with respect to which the Dirac operator is equiv-
ariant. However, we see from Corollary 5.4.17 of chapter 5 that the category proposed

by Wang does not admit a universal object in general.
