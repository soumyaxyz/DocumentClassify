both.

product/service search, product manufacturing or service delivery, quality
assurance, purchase, distribution, sales, marketing, finance and so on.

support, planning, training etc.

human resources management, IT management, customer relationship
management, partner management, and so on.

operations, new requirements emerge, and each function realigns its own
“internal services” to meet new demands.
