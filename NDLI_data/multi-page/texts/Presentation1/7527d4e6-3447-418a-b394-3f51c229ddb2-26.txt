Some conclusions

¢ All IT applications required to run an enterprise will never be created at the same
time. There will be several generations of applications developed or purchased over
several years.

¢ All IT applications need maintenance as business rules and business environment
change, and each IT application will be at a different stage of maintenance at any
given point of time. Enterprises migrate from small IT applications to more robust
integrated suites as business grow.

* Enterprises chose the optimum hardware, software, OS, RDMS, network and
programming language available at the time of making build or buy decision. This
results in heterogeneous hardware and multi vendor software products in the same
enterprise. Also, enterprises may acquire other businesses to expand their growth in
a non lonear ways, and this may again result in multiple technologies to co-exist in
the same enterprise.

¢ The same way, enterprises may have ERP, home grown applications, partially
outsourced IT application development etc.

¢ Enterprises may loosely bring together several applications in an enterprise portal
but may have limitations in terms of data exchange across IT applications.

¢ Enterprises may design new applications to combine data from several critical data
sources for the management information system(MIS).
