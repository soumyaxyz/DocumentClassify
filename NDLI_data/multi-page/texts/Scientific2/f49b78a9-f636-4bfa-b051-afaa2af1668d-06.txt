¢ Step 2. On receiving the registration request, the GW N
computes ky. = h(ID, || LTS) using the user
U’s identity [D,, and its long term secret key LTS,
and also generates a dynamic identity DID, for the
U. Additionally, to handle the issue of desynchroniza-
tion or DoS attack as described in (2), the GWN
generates PIDg = {pido,--- ,pid,} as a set of un-
linkable pseudo-identities for the user U. Finally, the
GWN issues a smart card SC, containing the infor-

mation DID,, ky,,.., PID, and the system parameters

param = {h(-), PUF(-), Gen(-), Rep(-), et, Zp} for
the user U through a secure channel.

e Step 3. On receiving the smart card SC,,, the user U
selects his/her password PW,, and imprints the bio-
metric 3,,, and calculates y,, = PUF(@,,). Using the
fuzzy generator function Gen(-), the smart card SC,
generates the biometric token a,, and the correspond-
ing reproduction parameter hd,,. Next, SC’, calculates
IPB =h(ID, || ow || PW.) and saves it in its mem-
ory. SC, also encrypts hd, as hd* = hd,® h(a, ||
ID, || PW.), DID, as DIDS = DID,® h(IDy ||
PW.,, || aw) and PID, as PID* = {pid?|i € [1, s]}
where pid = pid;® h(a, || PW. || [Du ||
Finally, the values DID, Kuyre and PID,, in the smart
card SC, are replaced with DIDy, ki, and PID),
respectively to complete the user registration process.

D. MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION AND SESSION KEY
AGREEMENT PHASE

A registered user U can access an enrolled smart device SD
using the following steps described below. In this phase, both
the user U and smart device SD can mutually authenticate in
presence of the GW N and also negotiate a session key SK.

« Step 1. The user U provides his/he identity [D,,, pass-
word PW,, and imprints biometric 3, at the sensor of
a specific terminal. The smart card SC, then decrypts
the biometric reproduction parameter hd, from hd*
using JD, and PW,,. By passing 3, and hd,, to the
fuzzy reproduction function Rep(-), SC,, reconstructs
the biometric token a,,. SC, then calculates JPB’ =
AUD, || au || PW,). If IPB # IPB’, the lo-
gin attempt will fail. Otherwise, DID, = DID*‘®
h(ID,, || PW, || au) and ku. = Kine ® M(PWy l|
a, || [D,,) are recovered. SC, also selects two random
nonces ky1,ku2 € Zp, from which the short term keys
kua = h(kur || [Du) and kug = h(Ku2 || ID.) are
ol Next, the values Qua = kua® h(ID, ||

Busnes Quy = bus® Mbp || 1Dy), DIDa = Dae
h(kug) and Authy = h(kug || Kua || kupre || D2Da)
are calculated. Note that " Dqgand DID, are the identity
and the single-use dynamic identity of the smart device
SD. Finally SC, composes the login request message
M, = (DID, Qug; Qua, DIDa, Auth,,) and sends it
to the gateway node GW N via open channel.

« Step 2. On receiving the login request message Mj, the
GW WN check for DID, in its database. If DID,, is not
found, the login request request is rejected. Otherwise,
it looks up for the corresponding user identity [D,, and
calculates ky. = h(IDy || LTS). The GWN then
recovers ig = Qua® h(IDu || ku,,<) and kg =
Qug® h(kuyr. || Du) from Qua and Qug, respectively.

The GWN also calculates Auth(, = h(ki, ||

|| Kupre || DJDa) and checks it against the received
Auth,,. If the values match, the GW N updates DID,
with DID!, = h(DID,, || kug) in its database and
recovers [Dg = DIDa® h(kiug)- The GW N looks up
for the challenge response pair (Cy,, Ra,) using [Dy
from the sets Cy and Ra, respectively. If it is so, the
challenge-response pair (Cy,,Ra,) is purged from Cy
and Ry. Now, the GWN computes Q, = k’,, ®Ra,,
Authr, =h(kig || Ra.) and Authg = h(
ki 4 || Authp,). The GWN composes the authentica-
tion request message My = (Cu,, Qg, Authr,, Auth)
and sends it to the accessed smart device SD for which
the user U wants to access the real-time data, via an
open channel.

« Step 3. On receiving the authentication request mes-
sage M2, the designated smart device SD looks up
for hda, corresponding to Cy, from the sets Cy and
hdq. Using hda, the PU F(-) and the fuzzy reproduction
function Rep(-), the smart. device SD calculates Ri), =
rep(PUF(Ca,), hda,), k wud = Qg® RG, and Auth, =
h( Wl Rey || Authr,), and then checks Auth,
against the ‘received Authg. If these match, the SD
selects a random nonce ky € Z, from which the short
term key ka, = h(ka || [Dqa) is derived. SD then
computes Qa = Ry, Okau, Qri, = h(kiia) ORY,, the
session key shared with the user U as SK = h(kau ||
