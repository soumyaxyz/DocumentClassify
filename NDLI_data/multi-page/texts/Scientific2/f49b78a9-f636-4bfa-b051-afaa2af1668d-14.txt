160 + 160) = 608 bits and (160 + 160 + 160 + 160) = 640
bits during the time of the login and authentication phase.
The total communication overhead of the proposed scheme
is then (800 + 608 + 640) = 2048 bits, that is, 256 bytes. In
Table B] we summarize the communication costs as well as
the number of messages exchanged for the proposed schemes
and compared schemes. We can observe that the proposed
scheme commends the lowest communication overhead as
compared to that for the other schemes.

C. SECURITY AND FUNCTIONALITY FEATURES
COMPARISON

tabulates the security & functionality features of the
proposed scheme and other existing schemes. It is appar-
ent that the proposed scheme offers superior security and
more functionality features as compared to other compared
schemes. The schemes proposed in [12] and [5], while these
are closed in terms of functionally & security features, the
scheme [12] achieves these at much higher computation
and communication overheads. Additionally, the scheme
fails to resist ESL attack under the CK adversary model. On
the other hand, the scheme [5] requires clock synchronization
and it provides no resolution for device impersonation attack.

 

 

Vil. PRACTICAL IMPACT STUDY

In this section, through a simulation study using the widely
accepted NS3 (3.28) simulator [59], we measure the impact
of the proposed scheme on various network performance
parameters, such as network throughput (in bytes per sec-
ond), end-to-end delay (in seconds), packet delivery ratio and

14

packet loss rate (in number of packets per seconds).

We ran several simulations, with different number of users
and smart devices for each. We simulated a single fixed
access point which operated as the gateway node. The smart
devices were radially scattered along a ring (inner radius
20 m and outer radius 100 m) centered on the gateway
node GW N. The users were permitted to move freely (and
randomly) across a square area of side 150 m and centered
on the GW. All the nodes communicate over 2.4 GHz
IEEE 802.11 wi-fi standard. Additional details about the
simulations are tabulated in Table[5] Any details that are not
explicitly mentioned means that those are assume the default
values as specified by NS3 (3.28) simulator.
