B. FORMAL SECURITY VERIFICATION THROUGH
AVISPA SIMULATION

In this section, we perform the formal security verification
on the proposed scheme using the broadly-accepted AVISPA
tool [49].

AVISPA is a push button tool for the automated validation
of security protocols. AVISPA implements the Dolev-Yao
(DY) threat model [6] to test if a security protocol is safe
or unsafe against replay & man-in-the-middle attacks. The
security protocol to be analyzed in AVISPA requires to be im-
plemented under the role-oriented language, known as “High
Level Protocol Specification Language (HLPSL)” (54). A
built-in translator, called HLPSL2IF, converts HLPSL code
to the “Intermediate Format (IF). The IF is then passed into
one of the four available backends for AVISPA to produce the
“Output Format (OF)”.

The four backends in AVISPA are as follows [49]:

VOLUME 7, 2019

e The first backend is “On-the-fly Model-Checker
(OFMC) that does several symbolic techniques to ex-
plore the state space in a demand-driven way”.

« The second backend is the “CL-AtSe (Constraint-Logic-
based Attack Searcher) that provides a translation from
any security protocol specification written as transition
relation in intermediate format into a set of constraints
which are effectively used to find whether there are
attacks on protocols”.

e The third backend is the “SAT-based Model-Checker
(SATMC) that builds a propositional formula which is
then fed to a state-of-the-art SAT solver and any model
found is translated back into an attack”.

e The fourth backend is the “TA4SP (Tree Automata
based on Automatic Approximations for the Analysis
of Security Protocols) that approximates the intruder
knowledge by using regular tree languages”.

The OF has various sections as described below [49].

« SUMMARY: It mentions “whether the tested protocol is
safe, unsafe, or whether the analysis is inconclusive”.

« DETAILS: It tells “a detailed explanation of why the
tested protocol is concluded as safe, or under what
conditions the test application or protocol is exploitable
using an attack, or why the analysis is inconclusive”.

« PROTOCOL: This defines the “HLPSL specification of
the target protocol in IF”.

« GOAL: It is “the goal of the analysis which is being
performed by AVISPA using HLPSL specification”.

« BACKEND: It provides “the name of the back-end that
is used for the analysis, that is, one of OFMC, CL-AtSe,
SATMC, and TA4SP”.

« Final section includes “the trace of possible vulnerabil-
ity to the target protocol, if any, along with some useful
statistics and relevant comments”.

More details regarding AVISPA and HLPSL can be found in
:

The user registration, device enrollment, login & authen-
tication phases for the proposed scheme are implemented in
HLPSL. In our implementation, three basic roles for a user
U, the GW N and a smart device SD are defined in HLPSL.
The compulsory roles for the session and goal & environment
are also defined in HLPSL.

We then evaluate the proposed scheme against replay
and man-in-the-middle attacks under the popular backends,
OFMC and CL-AtSe using the SPAN, the Security Protocol
ANimator for AVISPA tool [55]. Fig. [8] presents the sim-
ulation results showing that the proposed scheme is secure
against replay & man-in-the middle attacks.

C. INFORMAL SECURITY ANALYSIS

In this section, through informal security analysis, we
demonstrate the security features of the proposed scheme as
well as its resilience against well-known attacks.
