7) Resilience against Privileged-Insider Attack

An adversary A, who acts as a privileged-insider user of the
GW N, can intercept the initial registration request informa-
tion /_D,,. Also, none of the authentication messages contains
any value dependent on the secrecy of J.D,,. Additionally, as-
suming that the privileged adversary attempts the previously
discussed offline guessing attack with a stolen smart card, he
or she will still need to simultaneously guess password PW,
and biometric key a.,,. It is then a computationally infeasible
task for A too. Thus, the proposed scheme is secure against
privileged-insider attack.

8) Resilience against Physical Capture of Smart Device
Suppose A can physically capture some smart devices. Then,
A can extract all the secret credentials from the memory of
a physically captured smart device SD compromising of the
information {[Da, Ca, hda} from S'D’s memory. However,
as [Dg and {Cy} are generated randomly, these are distinct
and independent for all deployed smart devices. Hence, the
compromised information does not help in computing the
session keys among a user U and other non-compromised
sensing devices SD’. Additionally, due to the use of PUF(-)
in this authentication scheme, A cannot even impersonate
already compromised smart devices. This is because of the
nature of PUF(-:), A cannot compute {Ry} from {Cu, hda},
which is essential for generating the valid message M3 =
(HQr, Qa, Qry,, Autha). Thus, the proposed scheme is un-
conditionally secure against physical capture of smart de-
vices.

Vi. COMPARATIVE STUDY

In this section, we preform a detailed comparative study of
the proposed scheme in terms of security & functionality
features, communication and computational overheads with
other existing related schemes, such as the schemes proposed
by Gope er al. [12] , Zhou er al. [46], Wazid er al. (5) and
Chang and Le [36]. For the scheme [36], we consider its
ECC-based version as it is more secure than its basic version.

eration and hash operation, respectively. Based on experi-
mental results reported in , we have Tr, 8.7,
Tm © 63.075, Ty ~ Tm = 63.075 and Th 0.5
milliseconds, respectively.

In the proposed scheme, during the login and authentica-
tion process, the user U, the GW N and the smart device SD
need to perform 177}, + Ty, 87}, and 67), + Tp operations,
respectively. Thus, the total computation cost is 317}, + 27,
that requires approximately 141.65 ms. Table [2]summarizes
the computational cost for the compared schemes. It is clear
that the proposed scheme has a much lower computational
overhead as compared to that for other schemes |*| with
the exception of the schemes [40], [46]. However, both the
schemes [40], [46] are two-factor authentication schemes
with poor security & functionality features (see Table [Ap and
higher communication overhead (see Table

B. COMMUNICATION COSTS COMPARISON

In order to compute the communication overheads of the
different schemes, we assume that the hash digest (assuming
SHA-1 hash algorithm [58]) and identity to be 160 bits each,
random nonce and PUF challenge-response pair each to be
128 bits long. For other schemes, we additionally assume the
timestamp to be 32 bits long, ECC point to be 320 bits and
a ciphertext block (assuming Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES-128) symmetric encryption) to be 128 bits.

In the proposed scheme, three exchanged messages M1 =
(DIDu, Qug, Qua, DIDa, Authy), Mz = (Ca;, Qg,
Authp,, Auth,) and M3 = (HQpr, Qa, Qr:,, Autha)
require (160+160+160+160+160) = 800 bits, (128+160+

?It should be noted that the scheme in [12], as presented by Gope er al.,
assumes ideal PUFs. But, all other schemes account for noisy PUF/biometric
for the sake of fairness. We have assumed that all PUFs and Biometric are
processed through the corresponding fuzzy extractor. The values reported in
Table[2Jare account for use of fuzzy extractor.
