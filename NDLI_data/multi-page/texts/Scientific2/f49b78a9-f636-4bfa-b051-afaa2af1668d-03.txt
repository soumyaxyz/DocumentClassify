Il. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide a short description of the theoret-
ical background that is essential in this paper.

A. ONE-WAY CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION
One-way hash functions are extensively applied for data
integrity. Cryptographic one-way hash functions are designed
in such a way that they should be highly sensitive to even
slight perturbations to the input. For example, even for two
very similar inputs with little difference, the outputs are
produced in such a way that they cannot be correlated to
each other. Formally, a “collision-resistant one-way hash
function” can be defined as follows [8].

Definition 1: Let h: {0,1}* — {0,1}" denote a one-way
hash function. Upon receiving a variable length input, h(-)
gives a fixed-size length output of n bits, called the message
digest or hash output. If Adv’*s"(t) is defined as an adver-
sary A’s advantage in detecting hash collision in runtime tf,
Advies"(t) = Pr{(v1,%2) €rR A: 21 # x2 and h(x) =
h(x2)], where Pr[X| is the probability of a random event X,
and «1 & x2 are strings that are randomly selected by A. An
(@, t)-adversary A attacking a hash collision of h(-) means
that with maximum execution time ¢, Adv figs" (t )<¢.

B. PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTION

The Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are designed to
map an input uniquely to an output based on the physical
microstructure of a device. An input-output pair together

is known as a challenge-response pair and it is unique to
each individual PUF circuit. A PUF circuit must exhibit the
following properties :

« The output of a PUF circuit must depend on the physical

microstructure of the system.
¢ The output of a PUF must be unpredictable.
« The PUF circuit must be easy to evaluate as well as to
implement.

« The PUF circuit must be unclonable.
As the output of PUF is dependent on the physical charac-
teristics, any alteration to the system will change in the PUF
output. It is further assumed that it is impossible to tamper
the communication between PUF and its host device as in
pointed out in [13].
Definition 2: A PUF, say (PU F}), is secure, if for two input
challenges C1, C2 € {0,1}*, it produces output responses
Ri, Ro € {0,1}* with at least d; variation, and for any two
different PUFs (PU F;, PU F>) an input challenge C, should
produce distinct output responses Ri, Ro € {0,1}* with at
least dy variation. In other words,

Pr[H D(PUF,(C,), PUF\(C,)) >
Pr[HD(PUF,(C\), PUF,(C\)) > da] =1—e,

d,]=1-e,

where ¢ is a negligibly small value, C, and C2 are challenges
randomly selected by A, HD defines the Hamming distance,
and d, and dz are the error tolerance thresholds for PUF.

C. FUZZY EXTRACTOR
Even though now-a-days a PUF circuits can be developed
with a high degree of reliability, noise in PUF remains an
