1) Attainment of Mutual Authentication

In the proposed authentication scheme, during the authenti-
cation phase the GW N establishes trust in the authenticity
of U if it can look up its identity /D, from its memory
using the received DID,,. The check on Auth, ensures the
integrity of the received message. SD on receiving the mes-
sage My = (Ca,,Qg, Authr,, Authg) computes Auth’, and
checks it against the received Auth,. If the values match, SD
can trust that the message is genuinely from the GWN. U
on receiving the message M3 = (HQr, Qa, Qn, Autha),
computes Rij and Auth’,, from the received values. If
Authp, # h(kug || RG,), U authenticate SD. Thus, mutual
authentication between the user U and the smart device SD
is attained in the proposed scheme.

2) Attainment of Anonymity and Untraceability

An eavesdropping adversary A can monitor the messages
M,, Mz and M3. However, none of these eavesdropped
messages contain any identifying information for user or
smart device in plaintext formats. Thus, the proposed scheme
provides both user and smart device anonymity. Moreover,
all of these messages are composed using random nonces
and long-term secrets, and thus, these are dynamic in na-
ture across different authentication sessions. Therefore, it
is infeasible for A to trace both the user and smart device
across sessions. Thus, the proposed scheme preserves the
untraceability property for user and smart device.

3) Attainment of Forward and Backward Secrecy

Assuming that A can somehow learn the session key Sir
along with all its contributing secret values k,,, [Du, ka,
IDq and Ra, under the CK-adversary model (as discussed
in the threat model in Section (EB). All other values are
for single use, and therefore, compromise of a particular
session will not compromise the session keys of any sessions
previously established or to be established in the future. Thus,
the proposed scheme ensures forward & backward secrecy.

4) Resilience against Ephemeral Secret Leakage (ESL)
Attack

In the proposed scheme, both a user U and a smart device SD
establish a common session key SK = h(kau || Kua || Ra,)
during the execution of login & authentication phase, where
kua is a secret comprising of a short term secret k,,, and long
term secret [.D,,. Similarly, kq,, is another secret comprising
of a short term secret kg and long term secret J.Da, and Ra;
is a long term single use secret.

The security of the session key SK is then based on the

following two cases:

e Case 1. Assume that A has the short term secret creden-
tials k,,, and kg. Then, it is computationally infeasible
for A to calculate the session key SA without knowl-
edge of the long term secret credentials.

« Case 2. If some or all of the long term secrets [D,,, [Da
and Ra, are revealed to A, it is also computationally
infeasible for A to calculate SA without short term
secrets k,,, and ka.

Thus, A can derive the valid session key SK only if both
short and long term secrets are exposed at once. Hence, it
is evident that the proposed scheme is resilient against ESL
attack.

5) Resilience against Impersonation Attacks

Assume that an adversary A attempts to impersonate
a legitimate user U. As the pre-shared dynamic iden-
tity DIDy and the set pseudo-identities {PID,,} are
of single use, A cannot composite the message M, =
(DID. Quy, Qua; DI Da, Auth,,). Similarly, if A attempts
to impersonate the GW N by intercepting , generating
the message Mz = (Ca,,Qg, Authp,, Authg) is compu-
tationally infeasible as A does not have access to the chal-
lenge response pair (Cy,, Ry,). Hence, A will not succeed
in composing Auth, = h(Ca,||Ra,||Kug||Authr,) that is
consistent with Cy,. Finally, if A attempts to impersonate
SD by generating Mz = (HQr, Qa, Qr:,, Autha), it will be
computationally infeasible. As A is not able to recreate Ry,
and HQr = h(R4, || Qua) PAuthe,, QR, = hha) ®RG,
and Authy = h(SK || Rj,), he or she cannot compose a
consistent 1/3. Thus, the proposed scheme is resistant against
impersonation attacks.

6) Resilience against Stolen Smart Card and Offline
Guessing Attacks

Assume that an adversary A extracts the secret credentials
from a lost or stolen SC; of a registered user U through
power analysis attacks [7]. Then, A will have the credentials
IPB, DID; ku,,, and hd;,. But, as all of these values are
secured with the secret identity [D,,, password PW.,, and the
biometric key a,,, A needs simultaneous guessing of all three
factors to compromise the security of the proposed scheme.
Thus, it becomes a computationally infeasible problem for A,
and as a result, the proposed scheme is secure against offline
guessing attacks in conjunction with the stolen smart card
attack.
