2) Pseudo Identity Renewal Phase

As noted in Remark [I] the user U utilizes pid; € PI Dg to
authenticate in case of desyncronization with the GW N. The
set PI Dg is finite and will eventually get exhausted. Before
this happens, the user U must acquire additional pseudo
identities. The following steps are essential to achieve this

e Step 1. The user U logs into the system as described
in Section see Step 1), and other steps that are
very similar. U then composes the message Mpia, =
(DID, Qug, Auth.) which is sent to the gateway node
GW N via open channel.
Step 2. On receiving Mpiag,, the GWN checks for
DID, in its database. If DID, is not found, the au-
thentication request is rejected. Otherwise, the GW N
looks up for the corresponding user identity /D,, and
creates Kupre = HID, || LTS), and also recovers
= = Qua® h(k || 1D.) from Quy. The GWN
ea calculates rege = Alkug || Ku,,<) and checks
it against the received Auth,,. If the values match,
the GWN updates DID,, with DID/, = h(DID,, ||
kg) and generates PID!, = {pido, --- , pids} as a
new set of unlinkable pee MIOAIMCTTTER for the user U.
The GWN saves DID}, as DID,, and appends PID!,
to PID, in its memory. Now, the GWN computes
EPID = PID, Bh(kig || Kupre || LDu), Authg =
h(PID{, || kg || [Du), and finally composes the
message Myia, = (EPID, Auth,) to sends it to the
user U via open channel.

rized in Figure[6]

3) Challenge Response Renewal Phase
The challenge-response pairs (Ca, € Ca, Ra, € Ra) utilized
for mutual authentication between a smart device SD and
gateway node GW N are finite and will also eventually get
exhausted. Before this situation occurs, the gateway node
GW must acquire additional challenge-response pairs for
future operation. The steps involved in this process are de-
scribed below.
¢ Step 1. The GWN looks up for a challenge response
pair (Ca,,Ra,) using [Dg from the sets Cg and Ry.
