(b) for clause (4), the following clauses and the Explanation shall be substituted,
namely:-

“(4) The court shall have regard as to whether such evidence has or will have
sufficient probative value to outweigh its prejudicial effect, in the circumstances of the

inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.

Explanation:- Where, in a suit for damages for defamation for injury to the
reputation of a person, an aspect of the character of that person, other than that to
which the matter alleged to be defamatory relates, is likely to be injured by a
question under this section, the court shall have particular regard to the question
whether, having regard to the considerations mentioned in this section, such
question is proper”.
