“(2) Nothing in this section shall disentitle the party so permitted, to rely on any
part of the evidence of such witness.”

Substitution of section 155

88. For section 155 of the principal Act, the following sections shall be substituted,
namely-

Impeaching the credit of witness

“155. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the
adverse party, or with the permission of the Court, by the party who calls him-

(1) by the evidence of persons who, from their knowledge of the witness,
could impeach his credibility, accuracy or veracity;

(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed or has accepted the offer of a
bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement, to give his evidence;

(3) subject to the provisions of sec. 145, by proof of former statements
inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be
contradicted, that is to say, evidence on a fact in issue or a relevant fact or
evidence relating to any matter referred to in the First or Second
Exception to section 153;

and provided that the Court is satisfied that the probative value of the answer to
the question has or would override the prejudicial effect thereof.

Explanation. A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may
not, upon his examination—in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked
his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be
contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false
evidence.

Illustrations:

(a) A sues B for the price of goods sold and delivered to B. C says that he
delivered the goods to B.

Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he had
not delivered goods to B.

The evidence is admissible.

(b) A is indicted for the murder of B.
