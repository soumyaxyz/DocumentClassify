between its mother and any man, or within two hundred and eighty days,

(i)
(ai)

after the marriage was declared nullity, the mother remaining unmarried,
or

after the marriage was avoided by dissolution, the mother remaining
unmarried,

shall be conclusive proof that such person is the legitimate child of that man, unless

(a) it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to each
other at any time when the child could have been begotten; or

(b) it is conclusively established, by tests conducted at the expense of that
man, namely,

(i) medical tests, that, at the relevant time, that man was impotent
or sterile, and is not the father of the child; or

(ii) blood tests conducted with the consent of that man and his wife
and in the case of the child, by permission of the Court, that
that man is not the father of the child; or

(ili) | DNA genetic printing tests conducted with the consent of that
man and in the case of the child, by permission of the Court,
that that man is not the father of the child; and

conducted, and they resulted in an identical verdict that that man is not
the father of the child.

Provided further that where that man refuses to undergo the tests under
sub clauses (i) or (ii) or (iii), he shall, without prejudice to the provisions
of clause (a), be deemed to have waived his defence to any claim of
paternity made against him.

Explanation I: For the purpose of sub clause (iii) of clause (b), the words
