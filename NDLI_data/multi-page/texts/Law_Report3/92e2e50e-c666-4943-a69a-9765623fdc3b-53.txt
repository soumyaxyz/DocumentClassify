Impeaching the credit of the accused while examining him as a witness

155A. When an accused person offers himself as a witness in pursuance of
section 315 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it shall not be permissible to put
questions to another witness and such witness, if asked, shall not be compelled to answer,
questions which tend to show that the accused has committed or has been convicted or
been charged with any offence other than that in which the accused_is charged or that the
accused is of bad character, unless —

(i) the proof that the accused has committed or has been convicted of such other
offence is relevant to a matter in issue; or

(ii) the accused has personally or by his legal practitioner asked questions of the
witness for the prosecution with a view to establishing his own good character, or has
given evidence of his good character; or

(ii) the nature of the conduct of the defence is such as to involve imputations on the
character of the witness for the prosecution (other than the character of the
prosecutrix) without obtaining the leave of the Court for asking the particular
question; or

(iv) the accused has given evidence against any other person charged with the same
offence,

and the Court is satisfied that the probative value of the answer to the question has or
would outweigh the prejudice that may be caused.”
