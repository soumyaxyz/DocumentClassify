“33. Evidence given by a witness —

(a) in a previous judicial proceeding, or
(b) in an earlier stage of the same judicial proceeding, or

(c) in any proceeding before any person authorized by law to take
evidence,

is relevant in a subsequent judicial proceeding before a court, for the
purpose of proving the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness
is dead, or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept
out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained
without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of
the case, the Court considers unreasonable:

Provided-

(i) that the subsequent proceeding before the Court is between
the same parties or their representatives in interest;

(ii) that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right
and opportunity to cross-examine;

(iii) that the questions in issue are substantially the same in the
first as in the subsequent proceeding.

Explanation:- A criminal trial or inquiry shall in cases ,

(a) where the criminal proceedings are instituted by a private person, be deemed

(b)

to be a proceeding between that person and the accused within the
meaning of this section, if that person is permitted by the Court to conduct
the prosecution under section 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973; and

other than those referred to in clause (a) be deemed to be a proceeding
between the State and the accused.”
