then succession, whether intestate or under the testament shall,
nevertheless have effect as respects the intestate or testator, as if the
younger spouse has predeceased the intestate or the testator:

Provided that where the younger spouse, who is so deemed
to have predeceased the intestate or the testator is, according to
law, the sole heir or heir along with others, to the estate of the
intestate or the testator, then the younger spouse shall not to be so
deemed to have predeceased the intestate or the intestate under this
sub-section and the property of the intestate or testator shall
devolve according to law on the younger spouse and the heirs of
the said spouse may claim the estate of the said spouse.

Two brothers A and B die simultaneously in an accident and in that event,
B, the younger brother, shall be deemed to have survived A.

The husband A and his wife B die simultaneously in an accident. The
husband A has agricultural land and the wife has house property. In
respect of succession to the estate of A, the husband, by the husband’s
heirs, it shall be presumed that B the wife died earlier and B’s heirs’ shall
not therefore be entitled to claim the husband’s estate. In respect of
succession to the estate of B, the wife, by the wife’s heirs, it shall be
presumed that A, the husband died earlier and A’s heirs shall not be
entitled to claim the wife’s estate.

In the first part of Illustration (b), if the wife B is younger to the husband
A, but is to be deemed to have predeceased her husband, because of sub-
section (2), she will not be so deemed where, if she had survived the
husband A, she would have been the sole heir or have to a share along
with others to her husband’s estate, whether by virtue of intestacy or
testamentary succession and in that event, once such property of A, the
husband devolves on the wife B, her heirs would be entitled to claim the
same.

In the second part of Illustration (b), if the husband A is younger to the
wife B, but is to be deemed to have predeceased his wife, because of sub-
section (2), he will not be so deemed where, if he had survived the wife B,
he would have been the sole heir or heir to a share along with others to his
wife’s estate, whether by virtue of intestacy or testamentary succession
and in that event, once such property of B, the wife devolves on the
husband B, his heirs would be entitled to claim the same.”
