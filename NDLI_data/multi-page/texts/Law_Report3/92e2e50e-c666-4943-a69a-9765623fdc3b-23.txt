Substitution of new sections for sections 68 to 73

42. For sections 68 to 73 of the principal Act, the following sections shall be substituted,
namely:-

Proof of execution of will required by law to be attested

“68. (1) If a will is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence
of any testamentary disposition until one attesting witness at least has been called
for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive and
subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), an attestor need not
be called as a witness to prove the execution of a will if,-

(a) the attesting witness is incapable of giving evidence; or is kept
out of the way by the opposite party or by another person in
collusion with that party or is one whose presence cannot be
obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under
the circumstances of the case, the Court considers
unreasonable; or

(b) the will is in the possession of the opposite party; or

(c) a party wants to refer to any collateral fact contained in the
will; or

(d) the provisions of section 89 or section 90 apply.

Proof where no attesting witness is found

69. If no such attesting witness can be found as specified under sub-section
(1) of section 68, it must be proved that the attestation of one attesting witness at
least is in his handwriting, and that the signature of the person executing the will
is in the handwriting of the executant of the will.
