witness may be asked, whilst under examination” and ending with the words “the party
who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it”, the following shall be
substituted, namely:-

been proved which entitle the party who has called the said witness, to give
secondary evidence of it; and if, in the opinion of the Court, the document ought
to be produced, the objection shall be upheld.

(2) If a witness, while under examination, is about to make any statement as

of it; and, if in the opinion of the Court, the document ought to be produced, the
objection shall be upheld.”
