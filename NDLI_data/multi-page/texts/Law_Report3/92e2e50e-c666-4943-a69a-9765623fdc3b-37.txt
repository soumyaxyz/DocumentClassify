Substitution of section 116

“116 (1). No tenant of immoveable property, or person claiming through such
tenant, shall, during the continuance of the tenancy or any time thereafter, if the
tenant or the person claiming through such tenant, continuous in possession after
termination of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant
had, at the beginning of the tenancy, a title to such property; and no person who
came upon any immoveable property by the licence of the person in possession
thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had a title to such possession
at the time when such licence was given.

(2) Where a tenant in possession of immoveable property is attorned to
another, the tenant or any person claiming through him shall not, during the
continuance of the tenancy, or at any time thereafter if the tenant or the person
claiming through him continues in possession after termination of the tenancy, be
permitted to deny that the person to whom the tenant was attorned had, on the
date of the attornment, title to such immoveable property; but nothing in this sub-
section shall preclude the tenant or the person claiming through him from
producing evidence to the effect that the attornment was made under mistake or
was procured by fraud.”
