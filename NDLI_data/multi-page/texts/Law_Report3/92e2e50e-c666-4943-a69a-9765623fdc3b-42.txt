Explanation 2:- In this section and in sections 127 to 129, the expression ‘legal
practitioner’ or ‘legal professional adviser’ includes any person who, by law, is
empowered to appear on behalf of any other person before any judicial or
administrative authority; and the expression ‘client’ shall be construed
accordingly.

Explanation 3:- For the purpose of clause (b) of the proviso to this section, it is
immaterial whether the attention of such legal practitioner was or was not directed
to such fact by or on behalf of his client.

Illustrations.

(a) A, a client, says to B, a legal practitioner — “I have
committed forgery, and I wish you to defend me.”

As the defence of a man known to be guilty is not a criminal purpose, this
communication is protected from disclosure.

(b) A, a client, says to B, a legal practitioner — “I wish to
obtain possession of property by the use of a forged deed
on which I request you to sue.”

This communication being made in furtherance of a criminal purpose, is not
protected from disclosure.

(c) A, being charged with embezzlement, retains B, a
legal practitioner to defend him. In the course of
proceedings, B observes that an entry has been made in A’s
account book, charging A with the sum said to have been
embezzled, which entry was not in the book at the
commencement of his professional engagement.

This being a fact observed by B in the course of his engagement, showing that a
fraud has been committed since the commencement of the proceedings, it is not
protected from disclosure.”
