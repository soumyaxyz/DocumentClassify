Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly
under trial for same offence or offences

30. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence or
offences, and a confession made, before the commencement of trial, by one of
such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons in respect of same
offence or all the offences affecting himself and some other of such persons is
proved, the Court may, where there is other relevant evidence against such other
person or persons, take into consideration such confession as lending credence
against such other person or persons as well as against the person who makes
such confession.

Explanation: ‘Offence’ as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or
attempt to commit the offence.

Illustrations

(a) A and B are jointly tried for murder of C. It is proved that A said — “B

(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was
murdered by A and B, and that B said — “A and I murdered C.” This
statement may not be taken into consideration by the court against A, as B
is not being jointly tried.”
