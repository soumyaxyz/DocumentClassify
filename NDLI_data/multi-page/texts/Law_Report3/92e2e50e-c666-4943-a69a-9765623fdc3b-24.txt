Admission of execution by party to attested will

70. The admission by the executant of an attested will of its execution shall,
if such admission is made during his lifetime in a pleading or otherwise in the
course of a suit or proceeding, be sufficient proof of its execution as against those
who dispute the execution, though the will is one required by law to be attested.

Proof when attesting witness denies the execution

71. If the attesting witness called for the purpose of proving execution of a
will denies or does not recollect the execution of the will, its execution shall,
subject to the provisions of section 68, be proved, by calling other attesting
witnesses, before other evidence is adduced.

Proof of wills or other document not required by law to be attested

72. An attested will or other document not required by law to be attested may
be proved as if it was unattested.

Comparison of signature, writing or seal with others admitted or proved

73. (1) In order to ascertain whether a signature, writing or seal is that of
the person by whom it is alleged to have been written or made, any signature, writing
or seal admitted or proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been written or
made by that person may be compared by the Court or under its orders with the one
which is to be proved, although that signature, writing or seal has not been produced
or proved for any other purpose.

(2) The Court may direct any person present in Court to write any words or
figures for the purpose of comparison of the words or figures so written with any
words or figures alleged to have been written by such person.

(3) This section applies also, with any necessary modifications, to
finger impressions, palm impressions, footprints and type-writing.

(4) Without prejudice to the provisions of any other law for the time being in
force, nothing in this section shall apply to a criminal Court before it has taken
cognizance of an offence.‚Äù
