(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers
to prove that he refused to sell them below their value. A may prove these
statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct
influenced by facts in issue.

(e)A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit coin which he
knew to be counterfeit.

He offers to prove that he asked a skillful person to examine the coin as he
doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it and told
him it was genuine.

A may prove these facts for the reasons stated in the last preceding illustration.

under the rules hereinafter contained; or

(b) except where a document is produced and its genuineness is in question.”

Substitution of section 23

15. For section 23 of the principal Act, the following section shall be

to be given; or

compromise of a disputed claim; or

(c) under circumstances from which the Court can infer that the parties
agreed together that evidence of it should not be given,
