The mistake being frequently made, of persons ordering prints from
Part First, when they would be more pleased with those from Part
Turn, the publishers beg to state that those from Pant First are from
Old Paintings, Etchings, etc., which in many cases are badly damaged
by age, or otherwise, allof which imperfections show in the photograph ;
whereas those from Part Tuirp are mostly from Engravings or fresh
Modern Paintings, and consequently have a more finished look, and will
be much more satisfactory, EXCEPT WHEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ORIGINALS
ARE ESPECIALLY DESIRED.
