WE HAVE JUST PUBLISHED A NEW ART Book,
ENTITLED:

CV 1 . :
Dome Famous Paintings and their Homes.
A COMPILATION FROM LEADING AUTHORITIES, BY

MARY GRAHAM DUFF.

This work is a description of some twenty leading paintings
by the old masters, with what is known of their history, and also
a description of the Church or Gallery where each is now located.

Blank leaves are left for the insertion of unmounted photo-
graphs illustrating the painting described and the present home
of the work,

The novel and attractive feature of this book is the fact of its
combining a valuable text and reference book, with a most inter-
esting art serap book. Blank leaves are left for seventy-two
photographs, which may be purchased with the book or added, a
few at a time, as the student progresses. The photographs are
iaserted by attaching them to the blank leaves by one edge only,
using a very thick boiled flour paste, as described in the preface.

Printed on heavy paper, with broad margins, and handsomely
bound in cloth.

$1.50 PER COPY.

Special rates for six or more copies for class use.
