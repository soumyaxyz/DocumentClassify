GREEK SCULPTURE.

BRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON.
The Elgin Marbles.

This gallery contains the Bass-reliefs and Sculptures removed from the Parthenon in
the Acropolis at Athens. It contains 16 of the 92 Metopes which were round the outside
ofthe Parthenon, a considerable portion of the Frieze which runs round the cedda or body
of the temple, and many of the figures which filled the Eastern and Western Pediments.

The following Photographs take np (I.) the Metopes, (IL.) the Frieze, and (ILL) the
Sculptures in the Western and Easteru Pediments, respectively.

Note. — These sculptures are in a mutilated condition, the Metopes being the best pre-
served portion of the collection.

Metopes.

The Metopes of the Parthenon are the Bass-reliefs in the square spaces between the
Triglyphs on the entablature.

Note. —'The Parthenon was erected under Pericles, after the destruction of the former
pbuilding by the Persians, and was completed 440 B.C. It was erected by the Masters
Tetinus and Callistrates, and adorned with sculptures by Phidias. The Metopes in the
Musenm comprise 16 of the 92 which ran round the building, 14 of which were at cither
end, and 82 at each side of the building. Owing to the destrnetion of many of the
Metopes, and damage by the weather to others, it is difficult to decipher thcir entire
scheme, Gronps of combatants form the fundamental idea of the sculptures. In these
battles of the heroes, we recognize the prototypes of the youth of Attica, fighting, with
their whole strength, against the powers of ride force opposed to moral order in the life
of the state, such as the Amazons, who are hostile to marriage, and the Centaurs, dis-
turbers of peace and robbers of women, the foes of ‘Theseus, the founder of order and
law — one of the most favorite subjects of Attic art.

The Frieze of the Parthenon.

The Frieze of the cella or body of the Parthenon represented in bass-relief the Pana-
thenaie procession, which took place at the festival celebrated every four years at Athens
in honor of Athene (Minerva), the slabs extending over 524 feet ontside the ced/a, ‘The
t the festive procession which took place at the close of the festival; and in
tors of all previous days, the handsomest and strongest Athenians of all

and on foot, splendidly equipped, crowned with wreaths,
ranged in solemn order — the flower of civic community — presented themselves to
inity of the state. In this procession the whole mass of the people took part and
conveyed, in solemn form, the peplus, or sacred veil, — which had been previously worked
in the Acropolis by young virgins selected from the best families in Athens — to the temple
of Athene Polias, where it was placed, probably, on the knees of the goddess. The
actual procession mounting the Acropolis commenced at the south-west angle, and divided
itself into two sections, one going round by the north, the other by the south, and met at
the great eastern entrance. The slabs of the frieze take their subjects from the chief ma-
terials of this procession,
