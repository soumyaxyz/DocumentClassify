12) A number of accused granted bail by the courts have not been able to avail the
facility since they are unable to produce proper sureties. They continue to languish in
judicial remand. No legal aid is being provided to them.

23) “Though the number of arrests made without registering cases is of high
proportion (3746 out of 8889 of arrests, i.e. roughly 42.14%), as many as 3164 are
under preventive sections of law (108, 109, 110 and 151 CrPC). All these accused
either were bound over by a magistrate within the stipulated time or who were
released by the police agency itself. Hence, it is difficult to say that the power of arrest
is not exercised with circumspection.”

34) The daily allowance provided for food etc. to the arrested persons is too meagre.
Even this amount is not being drawn regularly from the treasury.

45) In 30% of the cases (54 out of 172), the accused are not being produced before the
court for various reasons.

56) On several dates of hearing when the accused were produced before the court the
cases were adjourned, or the accused was not examined or the witnesses were not
examined for one or the other reason.

67) “With the present quantum of work load on various courts in the district, the trial
of cases is inordinately delayed (statistics in table 10). Increase in the number of
courts, enhancing the scope of compoundable offences and limit on the number of
adjournments could be the solution to the problem.”

78) It would be appropriate if the courts hold their sittings in the jail premises itself
which would solve the problem of insufficiency of escort personnel. Such a measure
was experimented within Hyderabad city three years back with considerable amount
of success.

89) For serious crimes like dacoities, robberies, economic crimes and gender crimes
etc., special courts may be established to facilitate expeditious disposal of those
cases.”

So far as the statistics go, they disclose that out of 8889 arrests, 1209 and 418 are

under sections 109 and 110/108, CrPC. As already stated, the number of arrests
23

made without registering the crime is 3746. In the IPC offences, the arrests for
rioting and hurt cases are the largest being 1052 and 1653 respectively. Arrests under
Gambling Acts and Excise and Prohibition Acts are 277 and 151 respectively.

The facts and figures furnished from this State disclose that a large number of
arrests were made without registering a crime (more than 42%) and that “preventive
arrests” are quite substantial. A special feature of this state is the inability of producing
the accused before the Court on the dates of hearing, which has led the police to suggest
the venue of trials to jails. The phenomenon of frequent adjournments when the accused

is produced and the witnesses are also ready, is also emphasized.
