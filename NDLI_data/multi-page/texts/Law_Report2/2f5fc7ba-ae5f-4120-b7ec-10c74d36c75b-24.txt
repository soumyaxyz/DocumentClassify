such record, which is indeed a statutory record. ascertained during the investigation which
obviously relate to statements recorded by the officer in terms of section 161 and other
relevant material gathered during the investigation. In view of this state of affairs, the
Supreme Court suggested a legislative change to rectify this confusion and vagueness in
the matter of maintainance of diary under section 172. It is therefore appropriate that
section 172 be amended appropriately indicating the manner in which the diary under
section 172 is to be maintained, its contents and the manner in which its contents are
communicated to the court and the superior officers, if any. The significance of the case
diary has in its relevance as a safeguard against unfairness of police investigation. (See
this decision of the Delhi High Court in Ashok Kumar State

3.13 We may conclude this consultation paper with the thought articulated by Shri Justice
M.N. Venkatachaliah, the then Chairperson of N.H.R.C. that “power to stop, search,
arrest and interrogate are exercised against a person who may turn out ultimately to be
innocent, law-abiding citizen. Arrest has a diminishing and demoralizing effect on his
personality. He is outraged, alienated and becomes hostile. But then a balance has to be
struck between the security of the State (and the societal interest in peace and law and
order) on one hand and the individual freedom on the other.”

Your views on the aforesaid proposals are invited.
