1.13 Data furnished by various States.- A brief reference to the data furnished by the
various States would now be in order.
1.13.1 UTTAR PRADESH
According to the letter of Shri Hakim Singh, Headquarters, DGP (UP) dated 7.9.1999, the
relevant particulars for the State of UP for the year 1998 are to the following effect:
1(a) Total number of persons arrested (No. of persons 1,73,634
arrested under substantive offences)
1(b) Total number of persons who surrendered in 1,25,268
various courts (substantive offences)

filing chargesheet (substantive offences only)
15 How many persons ended in conviction — (Information not available).

6 Percentage of arrests made in relation to bailable 45.13%

offences

From the above figures it appears that while the total number of persons
arrested/surrendered is around three lakhs, the number of persons arrested under
“preventive provisions of law” is as high as 4,79,404. Obviously, the preventive
provisions mean the provisions like sections 151, 109 and 110 CrPC and similar other
provisions in local police enactments, if any. Another disturbing feature is the percentage
of arrests made in relation to bailable offences. It is as high as 45.13%.

In this State, Panchkula district was selected for study and data has been furnished in
respect of that district alone for the year 1998. According to the data furnished, the total
number of arrests during that year was 2,048. Out of this total number, 248 persons were
arrested in connection with crimes against persons, 232 for crimes against property, 160

as 94%,
