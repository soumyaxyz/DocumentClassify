apprehend him or that he is a habitual offender. (In case of the latter ground,
material in support of such ground shall be recorded.) Accordingly, the expression
“bailable” shall be omitted in respect of these offences and they should be termed
simply as cognizable
31

loffences. Section 41 may be amended appropriately to provide that in case of
these offences, no arrest shall be made except in the situation mentioned above.
Certain offences “excluded” from this annexure shall continue to be treated as
bailable-cognizable.

2(3) In respect of offences punishable with seven years imprisonment or less
which are mentioned in Annexure-V (from which annexure, offences punishable
under sections 124, 152, 216-A, 231, 233, 234, 237, 256, 257, 258, 260, 295 to
298, 403 to 408, 420, 466, 468, 477-A and 489-C, have been excluded) — and
which are at present treated by the Code of Criminal Procedure as non-bailable—
cognizable offences — should be treated as bailable-cognizable offences and dealt
with accordingly. So far the offences excluded from this category are concerned
(namely, offences punishable under section 124 and others mentioned above),

they shall continue to be treated as non-bailable-cognizable, as at present.
1(4) In respect of non-bailable-cognizable offences punishable with more than
seven years imprisonment, no change is proposed in the existing law.
2(5) So far as non-bailable-non-cognizable offences punishable up to seven years
are concermed, they are placed in the category of offences in Annexure-V, having
regard to the nature of offences, though they are treated by law as non-cognizable.

3.2 General principles to be observed in the matter of arrest.- The following general
principles shall be observed in the matter of arrest for offences (other than those offences
for which the punishment is life imprisonment or death but not offences where the

punishment can extend up to life imprisonment) shall be followed:-

32

Arrest shall be effected (a) where it is necessary to arrest the accused to bring his movements under restraint

to infuse confidence among the terror-stricken victims or where the accused is likely to abscond and evade

the process of law; (b) where the accused is given to violent behaviour and is likely to commit further

offences unless his movements are brought under restraint or the accused is a habitual offender and unless

kept in custody is likely to commit similar offences again; (c) where the arrest of the persons is necessary to

protect the arrested person himself; or (d) where such arrest is necessary to secure or preserve evidence of

or relating to the offence; or (e) where such arrest is necessary to obtain evidence from the person

concerned in an offence punishable with seven years or more, by questioning him.

In this connection, reference may be made to section 157 of Code of Criminal Procedure which says that

where a police officer proceeds to investigate the facts and circumstances of a case (on receiving

information about commission of an offence), he shall arrest the offender, only where it is “necessary”. Sub-

section (1) of section 157, insofar as relevant reads as follows:
“(1) If, from information received or otherwise, an officer in charge of a police station has reason
to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under section 156 to investigate,
he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such
offence upon a police report and shall proceed in person, or shall depute one of his subordinate
officers not being below such rank as the State Government may, by general or special order,
prescribe in this behalf, to proceed, to the spot, to investigate the facts and circumstances of the
case, and, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender....”

3.2.1 Merely on suspicion of complicity in an offence, no arrest to be made.- The law

must provide expressly, by amending section 41 and other relevant sections, if
