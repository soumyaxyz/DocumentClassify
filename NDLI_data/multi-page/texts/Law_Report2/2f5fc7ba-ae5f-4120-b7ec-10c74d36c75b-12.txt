It is evident that a substantial number of persons were arrested for excise offences.

The particulars of preventive arrests, if any, are not furnished nor the percentage of arrests
in bailable cases.
1.13.3 MAHARASHTRA
In this State, particulars have been furnished in respect of two districts, namely, Pune
rural district and Thane rural district. The particulars with respect to Pune rural district
are the following:

11. Total no. of persons arrested (no. of persons arrested under substantive offences) —

8943.

22. Total no. of persons arrested under preventive provisions of law — 4933.

33. Out of it, total no. of persons chargesheeted — 8836.

44. Total no. of persons dropped/released without filing chargesheet — 93. It does not

include persons arrested under preventive provisions of law.

55. Total no. of persons ended in conviction — 73.

16. Percentage of arrests made in relation to bailable offences — 72.90%.

The particulars with respect to Thane rural district are to the following effect:
1) Total no. of persons arrested 10,376
2) Total no. of persons arrested under preventive 7,566
provisions of law
3) Out of it, total no. Of persons chargesheeted 10,345
4) (A) Total no. of persons dropped/released 31

filing chargesheets, who arrested under
preventive provisions
5) How many persons ended in conviction 394
6) Percentage of arrests made in relation to 67.73%
bailable offences (7028)
It may be noticed that in case of both the said districts, the number of preventive arrests
are unusually high. It is more than one-half of the number of arrests for substantial
offence in the case of Pune rural and two-thirds in the case of Thane rural. Then again the
arrests made in relation to bailable offences are something ununderstandable. It is 72.90
and 67.73 per cent, respectively. (We are not referring to the number of convictions
because we presume that the reference to number of convictions in that year may not be
relatable to the total number of chargesheets filed during that year).

constituted to gather and supply the relevant information. Though the letter of the IGP,
Gujarat dated 14.10.1999 states that Ahmedabad rural district, a
