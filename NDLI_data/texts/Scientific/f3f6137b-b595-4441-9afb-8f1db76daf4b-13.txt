A Critical Survey of Mathematical Search Engines 205

We have not discussed different ranking schemes thereby, their precision and
recall value of the whole system in this study. Also we have not included the
search engines like Tangent [30] discussed in NII Testbeds and Community for
Information access Research Project (NTCIR-11: Math-2 Wikipedia subtask)
in this study Exploring meta-data of mathematical expressions can also play a
good direction for further research efforts. For e.g., MIaS although tried to cover
all challenges faced by previous systems, but weighting scheme for mathematical
expressions used in MIaS sometimes give more recall value (irrelevant results)
when the expression to be indexed become large, containing more symbols.

6 Conclusion

A lot of work was devoted towards developing MIR systems in the last decade
but only a handful of systems are available. This area of research is still evolving
and is gradually gaining attention from the researchers and organizations like
NTCIR etc. Various mathematical search engines are discussed here in this study
along with their design and working principle. Semantically same formulae can
be represented in various formats in various mathematical notations and pooling
them into one unified platform is a huge task.

Again most of the search engines are designed for specific mathematical anno-
tation and their internal representation of documents based on their specific task.
Also, not all of the search engines discussed in this survey have the ability to
provide partial results.

For indexing, most of the search engines take mathematical expressions as a
string token and uses Lucene or related framework based on the requirements
except for EgoMath2 which uses its own indexing tools.

MIR systems still need enormous improvements to be a mature information
retrieval system; which can handle all the challenges of annotations and ambi-
guities associated with mathematical or scientific data.
