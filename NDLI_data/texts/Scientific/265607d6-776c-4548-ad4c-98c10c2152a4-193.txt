8. Document Novelty

 

Q2. How does novelty perform in comparison to coverage?
Q3. How does novelty perform in combination with coverage?
Q4. What is the role of novelty as a diversification strategy?

We address the first three research questions in Section 8.3.2. To answer Q1,
we fix the diversification strategy to novelty, in order to evaluate the impact of
different aspect representations. Conversely, to tackle Q2 and Q3, we measure
the effectiveness of novelty in comparison to and in combination with coverage,
respectively, across multiple aspect representations, which are held fixed. Finally,
to provide further insights into the role of novelty as a diversification strategy,
in Section 8.3.3, we address Q4, by thoroughly evaluating this strategy with
simulated rankings of various quality. In the remainder of this section, we describe

the experimental setup that supports the investigation of these questions.

8.3.1 Experimental Setup

In this section, we describe the setup that supports our investigation. In partic-
ular, we describe the test collections, the retrieval approaches, and the training

procedure carried out for the experiments in Sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3.

8.3.1.1 Test Collections

Our experiments are based on the WT09 and WT10 test collections. As described
in Table 5.1, these test collections comprise 49 and 48 queries from the diversity
task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web track (Clarke et al., 2009a, 2010), re-
spectively. As a document corpus, we use the category B portion of ClueWeb09,
described in Section 5.1.1. We index this corpus with Terrier (Macdonald et al.,

2012a), after applying Porterâ€™s stemmer and removing stopwords.

8.3.1.2 Retrieval Approaches

To verify the consistency of our results, we experiment with several retrieval
approaches and aspect representations. Firstly, as an adhoc retrieval approach,

which does not perform diversification, we use the DPH model (Equation (2.31))
