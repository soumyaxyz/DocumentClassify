7.3 Experimental Evaluation
In this section, we address the third claim from our thesis statement:

“By maximising the relevance of the retrieved documents to multiple

sub-queries, a high coverage of these sub-queries can be achieved.”

To address this claim, we evaluate the effectiveness of our intent-aware ap-
proach to improve the coverage estimates leveraged by the xQuAD framework.*

In particular, we aim to answer the following research questions:
Ql. Can we improve diversification performance with our model selection regime?
Q2. Can we improve diversification performance with our model merging regime?

In the following, Section 7.3.1 details the experimental setup that supports the
investigation of these questions, including the test collections, the diversification
baselines, and the classification approaches used by the two regimes, as well as
the procedure carried out for training and evaluating all approaches. The results

of this investigation are discussed in Section 7.3.2.

4While the estimated relevance of a document with respect to a sub-query also impacts
xQuAD’s estimation of novelty, we leave the analysis of this component to Chapter 8.
