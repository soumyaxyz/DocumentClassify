4.1.5 Other features. OWL supports other language features not previously discussed, including:
annotation properties, which provide metadata about ontologies, such as versioning info; datatype
vs. object properties, which distinguish properties that take datatype values from those that do not;
and datatype facets, which allow for defining new datatypes by applying restrictions to existing
datatypes, such as to define that places in Chile must have a float between -66.0 and -110.0 as their
value for the (datatype) property latitude. For more details we refer to the OWL 2 standard [228].
We will further discuss methodologies for the creation of ontologies in Section 6.5.

4.2 Semantics and Entailment

The conditions listed in the previous tables indicate how each feature should be interpreted. These
conditions give rise to entailments, where, for example, in reference to the Symmetric feature
