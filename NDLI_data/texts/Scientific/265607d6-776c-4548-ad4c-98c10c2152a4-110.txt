4.2.2 Framework Components

Several dimensions of the diversification problem are naturally modelled as in-
dividual probabilities in Equation (4.7). In practice, these probabilities are esti-

mated by different components of the xQuAD framework, namely:

1. document relevance, p(d|q);
2. document diversity, p(d,D,|q), Vs € Sy:

(a) sub-query importance, p(s|q);
(b) document coverage, p(d|q, );

(c) document novelty, [] ajep,  ~ p(d;|q, 8).

Further components of the framework include the actual mechanism that gen-
erates the set of sub-queries S;, as well as the mechanism that computes the
diversification trade-off \ for a given query g. Each of these components can be
instantiated in a variety of ways, essentially generating different diversification
models within the xQuAD framework. As we will show in Chapters 5 through 9,
not only do these components add to the flexibility of xQuAD, but they also

provide multiple opportunities to devise effective diversification models.
