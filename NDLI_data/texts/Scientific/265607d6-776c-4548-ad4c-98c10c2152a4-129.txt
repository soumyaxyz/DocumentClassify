5. Framework Validation

 

denotes a statistically significant difference (or lack thereof) from the relevance
baseline, namely, DPH or LambdaMART. As described in Section 5.1.2, for each
evaluation metric, we also report the number of queries negatively affected (—),
positively affected (+), and unaffected (=) with respect to these baselines. In
addition, a second significance symbol, when present, denotes a significant differ-
ence from the best performing approach in each group, which is underlined. The
overall best approach in each column is highlighted in bold.

Table 5.6: Diversification performance of the xQuAD framework compared to MMR,

PC, and IA-Select, as prominent representatives of novelty-based, coverage-based, and
hybrid diversification approaches, respectively.

From Table 5.6, we first observe that xQuAD is the best performing of all con-
sidered approaches in terms of both ERR-IA@20 and a-nDCG@20, with gains
of up to 11% on top of DPH, and 4% on top of LambdaMART. These results
show that, while a high performing relevance baseline improves the overall diver-
sification performance, it also leaves less room for improvement. Nevertheless,
significant improvements compared to these relevance baselines are observed in
all cases, except for ERR-IA@20 when xQuAD is deployed on top of DPH.

Compared to the diversification baselines, significant improvements are ob-
served in many cases, particularly on top of DPH for a-nDCG, when MMR, PC,
and [A-Select are all significantly outperformed. Indeed, not only does xQuAD

perform consistently better on average, but it also compares favourably to all
