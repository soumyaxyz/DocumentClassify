3. Search Result Diversification

 

An alternative to the intent-aware framework of Agrawal et al. (2009) was
proposed by Sakai et al. (2010), as an extension to traditional metrics based
upon graded relevance, such as discounted cumulative gain (DCG; Jarvelin &
Kekalainen, 2002), described in Equation (2.51). In particular, instead of com-
puting the expected value of one such metric across each of the multiple aspects
A, underlying the query g, as in Equation (3.25), they proposed to extend this
metric to leverage the expected gain over multiple aspects—as opposed to the
raw gain with respect to the query q only. The introduced family of diversity

metrics, denoted “D” metrics, can be formalised according to:
D-Eval(q, «) = Eval(A,, «), (3.26)

where Eval(.A,,«) denotes a traditional graded relevance metric, with the gain
of the i-th document computed by aggregating the aspect-specific gains gj),, ac-
cording to g; = Yoae Ay p(alq) Gija- One basic advantage of this framework over the
intent-aware framework of Agrawal et al. (2009) is that the metric Eval(A,, &) is
computed for a single rather than for multiple separate rankings.

A limitation of both the IA and the D evaluation frameworks is that they
do not enforce a high coverage of multiple query aspects by design. As a result,
some metrics generated by these frameworks, such as DCG-IA (Agrawal et al.,
2009) or D-DCG (Sakai et al., 2010), may completely ignore aspects with a low
probability p(alq). In the extreme case, these metrics may end up maximally
rewarding a ranking that covers only a single yet dominant aspect. In order to
overcome this limitation, Sakai et al. (2010) proposed to linearly interpolate a
D metric with sub-topic recall (SR), defined in Equation (3.24). The resulting

metric, which they called a “Dz” metric, can be defined according to:
D#-Eval(g, 6) = SR(q,) + (1 — 9)D-Eval(q, f), (3.27)

where the parameter y controls the balance between the SR(q, «) and D-Eval(q, «)
metrics. Typically, this parameter is set as y = 0.5, as it was shown to have
little impact in the final value of Di-Eval(q,«), primarily because SR(q, «) and
D-Eval(q, «) are highly correlated with each other (Sakai et al., 2010).
