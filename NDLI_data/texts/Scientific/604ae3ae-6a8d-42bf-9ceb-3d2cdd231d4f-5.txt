Temporal Word Embeddings.

Following the discussion in Section B} we train a temporal word embedding for the first six books of HP. We focus
on the four characters which appear more frequently. The static embedding is trained with the whole text of each
book, while the dynamic embeddings are based on sub-slices containing text of length equal to 1000 characters.
For each character, we extract the corresponding trajectory for each book. For a better interpretation of the
relations, we consider the main character (i.e., Harry) and plot the evolution over time of the relative (cosine)
distances from the other characters. Since these vectors embed semantic information, it is expected that in the
trajectories corresponding to smaller distances correspond to closer relations with Henry. In fact, the results in
show that the trajectories of positive characters or friends (i.e., Ron and Hermione) move in a similar

A similar analysis for LW is reported in Figure [3} In this case we display a t-SNE two-dimensional
projection of the vectors over different groups of chapters for the four major characters (i.e., the four March
sisters). As a comment, the temporal word embedding seems to capture the separation, during the central part
of the plot, between Joe and Amy, i.e., the two characters who left their home town, and the other two.
