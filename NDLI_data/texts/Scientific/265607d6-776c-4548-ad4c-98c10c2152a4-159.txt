6.4.2.2 Diversification Performance

In this section, we address research question Q2, by assessing the effectiveness of
our produced suggestions when used for diversifying the retrieved documents. As
discussed in Section 6.3, for this evaluation, we use two different instantiations of
the s-deval metric defined in Equation (6.3), by leveraging the primary metrics for
diversity search evaluation used in the TREC Web track (Clarke et al., 2011b):
ERR-IA (Equation (3.28)) and a-nDCG (Equation (3.29)). In particular, we
consider the scenario where a user would inspect the top = 20 documents,
diversified by the xQuAD framework (as the reference diversification system)
using the top k suggestions provided by each query suggestion mechanism as a
set of sub-queries S,. As baselines for this investigation, we consider the initial
query, as well as the suggestions produced by Bing (BS) and BM25(QSC), as the
best performing unsupervised variant from Table 6.4. Table 6.6 shows the results

of this investigation, with significance symbols defined as in Table 6.5.

Table 6.6: Diversification performance (in terms of both s-ERR-IA@8,20 and s-a-
nDCG@8,20) attained by the suggestions produced by various mechanisms.

From Table 6.6, we first observe that both the unsupervised approach of Broc-

 

colo et al. (2012) using BM25 as well as our learning to rank approach using AFS
and LambdaMART significantly improve upon the initial query, attesting the
suitability of mining effective sub-queries from a query log to diversify a ranking
of documents. Moreover, the performance attained by these approaches does not
differ significantly from that attained by the suggestions produced by the Bing
API. Once again, this is a remarkable result, given the substantially larger amount

of data available to Bing compared to our one-month query log snapshot. Finally,
