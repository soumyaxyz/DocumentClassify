ABSTRACT

Mathematical notation, i.e., the writing system used to communi-
cate concepts in mathematics, encodes valuable information for
a variety of information search and retrieval systems. Yet, math-
ematical notations remain mostly unutilized by today’s systems.
In this paper, we present the first in-depth study on the distribu-
tions of mathematical notation in two large scientific corpora: the
open access arXiv (2.5B mathematical objects) and the mathemati-
cal reviewing service for pure and applied mathematics zDMATH
(61M mathematical objects). Our study lays a foundation for future
research projects on mathematical information retrieval for large
scientific corpora. Further, we demonstrate the relevance of our
results to a variety of use-cases. For example, to assist semantic
extraction systems, to improve scientific search engines, and to
facilitate specialized math recommendation systems.

The contributions of our presented research are as follows: (1)
we present the first distributional analysis of mathematical formu-
lae on arXiv and zbMATH; (2) we retrieve relevant mathematical

objects for given textual search queries (e.g., linking PLP) (x) with
‘Jacobi polynomial’); (3) we extend zbMATH’s search engine by pro-
viding relevant mathematical formulae; and (4) we exemplify the
applicability of the results by presenting auto-completion for math
inputs as the first contribution to math recommendation systems.
To expedite future research projects, we have made available our
source code and data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Taking into account mathematical notation in the literature leads to
a better understanding of scientific literature on the Web and allows
one to make use of semantic information in specialized Information
Retrieval (IR) systems. Nowadays applications in Math Information
Retrieval (MathIR) [15], such as search engines [7, 17, 18, 22, 24,
27, 31], semantic extraction systems [23, 36, 37], recent efforts in
math embeddings [10, 13, 25, 44], and semantic tagging of math
formulae [6, 43] either consider an entire equation as one entity or
only focus on single symbols. Since math expressions often contain
meaningful and important subexpressions, these applications could
benefit from an approach that lies between the extremes of exam-
ining only individual symbols or considering an entire equation as
one entity. Consider for example, the explicit definition for Jacobi
polynomials [8, (18.5.7)]
