The interesting components in this equation are pok ex) on the
left-hand side, and the appearance of the gamma function I(s)
on the right-hand side, implying a direct relationship between
Jacobi polynomials and the gamma function. Considering the entire
expression as a single object misses this important relationship.
On the other hand, focusing on single symbols can result in the
misleading interpretation of I as a variable and I'(@ + n + 1) as
a multiplication between I and (@ + n + 1). A system capable of
identifying the important components, such as poak Yor) or T(a+
n+ 1), is therefore desirable. Hereafter, we define these components
as Mathematical Objects of Interest (MOIs) [13].

The importance of math objects is a somewhat imprecise descrip-
tion and thus difficult to measure. Currently, not much effort has
been made in identifying meaningful subexpressions. Kristianto
et al. [23] introduced dependency graphs between formulae. With
this approach, they were able to build dependency graphs of math-
ematical expressions, but only if the expressions appeared as single
expressions in the context. For example, if [(a@ + n + 1) appears as a
stand-alone expression in the context, the algorithm will declare a
dependency with Equation (1). However, it is more likely that differ-
ent forms, such as I(s), appear in the context. Since this expression
does not match any subexpression in Equation (1), the approach
cannot establish a connection with I'(s). Kohlhase et al. studied
in [19-21] another approach to identify essential components in
formulae. They performed eye-tracking studies to identify impor-
tant areas in rendered mathematical formulae. While this is an
interesting approach that allows one to learn more about the in-
sights of human behaviors of reading and understanding math, it
is inaccessible for extensive studies.

This paper presents the first extensive frequency distribution
study of mathematical equations in two large scientific corpora, the
e-Print archive arXiv.org (hereafter referred to as arXiv!) and the
international reviewing service for pure and applied mathematics
zbMATH®. We will show that math expressions, similar to words in
natural language corpora, also obey Zipf’s law [33], and therefore
follows a Zipfian distribution. Related research projects observed a
relation to Zipf’s law for single math symbols [6, 36]. In the context
of quantitative linguistics, Zipf’s law states that given a text corpus,
the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank
in the frequency table. Motivated by the similarity to linguistic
properties, we will present a novel approach for ranking formulae
by their relevance via a customized version of the ranking function
BM25 [34]. We will present results that can be easily embedded
in other systems in order to distinguish between common and
uncommon notations within formulae. Our results lay a foundation
for future research projects in MathIR.

Fundamental knowledge on frequency distributions of math for-
mulae is beneficial for numerous applications in MathIR, ranging
from educational purposes [40] to math recommendation systems,
search engines [7, 31], and even automatic plagiarism detection
systems [28, 29, 39]. For example, students can search for the con-
ventions to write certain quantities in formulae; document prepara-
tion systems can integrate an auto-completion or auto-correction
service for math inputs; search or recommendation engines can

adjust their ranking scores with respect to standard notations; and
plagiarism detection systems can estimate whether two identical
formulae indicate potential plagiarism or are just using the con-
ventional notations in a particular subject area. To exemplify the
applicability of our findings, we present a textual search approach to
retrieve mathematical formulae. Further, we will extend z»MATH’s
faceted search by providing facets of mathematical formulae ac-
cording to a given textual search query. Lastly, we present a simple
auto-completion system for math inputs as a contribution towards
advancing mathematical recommendation systems. Further, we
show that the results provide useful insights for plagiarism detec-
tion algorithms. We provide access to the source code, the results,
and extended versions of all of the figures appearing in this paper

Related Work: Today, mathematical search engines index formu-
lae in a database. Much effort has been undertaken to make this
process as efficient as possible in terms of precision and runtime
performance [7, 17, 26, 27, 45]. The generated databases naturally
contain the information required to examine the distributions of
the indexed mathematical formulae. Yet, no in-depth studies of
these distributions have been undertaken. Instead, math search
engines focus on other aspects, such as devising novel similarity
measures and improving runtime efficiency. This is because the goal
of math search engines is to retrieve relevant (i.e., similar) formulae
which correspond to a given search query that partially [24, 26, 31]
or exclusively [7, 17, 18] contains formulae. However, for a fun-
damental study of distributions of mathematical expressions, no
similarity measures nor efficient lookup or indexing is required.
Thus, we use the general-purpose query language XQuery and em-
ploy the BaseX? implementation. BaseX is a free open-source XML
database engine, which is fully compatible with the latest XQuery
standard [14, 41]. Since our implementations rely on XQuery, we
are able to switch to any other database which allows for processing
via XQuery.

2 DATA PREPARATION

IéTpX is the de facto standard for the preparation of academic
manuscripts in the fields of mathematics and physics [11]. Since
I6TEX allows for advanced customizations and even computations,
it is challenging to process. For this reason, ATpX expressions are
unsuitable for an extensive distribution analysis of mathematical
notations. For mathematical expressions on the web, the XML for-
matted MATHML} is the current standard, as specified by the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The tree structure and the fixed
standard, i.e., MATHML tags, cannot be changed, thus making this
data format reliable. Several available tools are able to convert from
JATEX to MATHML [35] and various databases are able to index XML
data. Thus, for this study, we have chosen to focus on MATHML. In
the following, we investigate the databases arXMLiv (08/2018) [12]
and zbMATH? [38].

The arXMLiv dataset (~1.2 million documents) contains HTML5
versions of the documents from the e-Print archive arXiv.org.
The HTML5 documents were generated from the TEX sources
