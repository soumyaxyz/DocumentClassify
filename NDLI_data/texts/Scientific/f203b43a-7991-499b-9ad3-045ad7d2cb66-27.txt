TABLE 5 Popular evaluation datasets grouped by their type of source (Type).

Furthermore, several approaches to the creation of such datasets have been proposed, in the past |Medelyan et al.
Sterckx et al.|/2018}. Recently,Sterckx et al have created new keyphrase extraction collections consist-

ing of on-line news/sports, lifestyle magazines as well as newspaper articles, annotated by multiple annotators. These

   

collections are available for research purposes upon request to the article’s authors.
