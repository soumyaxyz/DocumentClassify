3. Search Result Diversification

 

Carterette & Chandar (2009) proposed a probabilistic approach for maximis-
ing the coverage of multiple “facets”, representing different aspects of a query.
Such facets were generated by constructing either relevance models (Lavrenko &
Croft, 2001) or topic models (Blei et al., 2003) from the top retrieved documents
for the query. Three strategies were proposed to re-rank the initially retrieved
documents R, with respect to their coverage of the identified facets. In particu-
lar, the best performing of these strategies selected the highest scored document
d for each facet z € Z, in a round-robin fashion. Such a facet modelling (FM)

approach can be formalised into the following objective function:

. p(d\q) if dz; € Z, | p(dlz;) > OAi = |D,| mod |Z,],
fen(q,4,Dy) = - \ " (3.15)
0 otherwise,

where Z, is the set of facets identified for the query g, p(d|z;) denotes the like-
lihood of observing each document d given the facet z; € Z,. The modulus
operation ensures a round-robin selection from a total of |Z,| facets. Since the
probabilities p(d|z;) are not comparable across facets, the documents selected in
the round-robin process are ultimately ordered by their likelihood given q.

A similar approach was investigated by He et al. (2011), by partitioning the
documents initially retrieved for a query into non-overlapping clusters using topic
modelling (Blei et al., 2003). In their approach, each cluster c € Z, received a
score p(clq), given by the cluster’s likelihood of generating the query g. As a
result, the diversification problem was reduced to the task of selecting documents
with a high coverage of highly scored clusters. Of the selection strategies in-
vestigated, a weighted round-robin selection (WRR) performed the best. This

selection strategy can be formalised according to:

p(d|q) if de, € Z,|d ec, Ai = |D,| mod |Z,|
fvan(4, 4, Dy) = s.t. p(cilg) > plealg) > +++ > plez,\lg), (3-16)

0 otherwise,

where the probability p(c;q) imposes a total ordering over the clusters c; € Z,,

essentially biasing the round-robin selection towards highly scored clusters.
