Moving to the 00’s, Jiang and Ma (2002) [257] introduce the notion of “plan knowledge graphs”
where nodes represent goals and edges dependencies between goals, further encoding supporting
degrees that can change upon further evidence. Search algorithms are then defined on the graph
to determine a plan for a particular goal. Helms and Buijsrogge (2005) [221] propose a knowl-
edge graph to represent the flow of knowledge in an organisation, with nodes representing
knowledge actors (creators, sharers, users), edges representing knowledge flow from one actor
to another, and edge weights indicating the “velocity” (delay of flow) and “viscosity” (the depth
of knowledge transferred). Graph algorithms are then proposed to find bottlenecks in knowl-
edge flow. Kasneci et al. (2008) [264] propose a search engine for knowledge graphs, defined to
be weighted directed edge-labelled graphs, where weights denote confidence scores based on the
centrality of source documents from which the edge/relation was extracted. From the same group,
Elbassuoni et al. (2009) [137] adopt a similar notion of a knowledge graph, adding edge attributes
to include keywords from the source, a count of supporting sources, etc., showing how the graph
can be queried. Coursey and Mihalcea (2009) [102] construct a knowledge graph from Wikipedia,
where nodes represent Wikipedia articles and categories, while edges represent the proximity of
nodes. Subsequently, given an input text, entity linking and centrality measures are applied over
the knowledge graph to determine relevant Wikipedia categories for the text.

Concluding with the 10’s (prior to 2012), Pechsiri and Piriyakul (2010) [378] use knowledge
graphs to capture “explanation knowledge” — the knowledge of why something is the way it is - by
representing events as nodes and causal relationships as edges, claiming that this graphical notation
offers more intuitive explanations to users; their work focuses on extracting such knowledge graphs
from text. Corby and Faron-Zucker (2010) [97] use the phrase “knowledge graph” in a general way
to denote any graph encoding knowledge, proposing an abstract machine for querying such graphs.

Other phrases were used to represent similar notions by other authors, including “information
graphs” [284], “information networks” [484], “knowledge networks” [87], as well as “semantic
networks” [62, 351, 525] and “conceptual graphs” [465], as mentioned previously. Here we exclu-
sively considered works that (happen to) use the phrase “knowledge graph” prior to Google’s
announcement of their knowledge graph in 2012, where we see that many works had independently
coined this phrase for different purposes. Similar to the current practice, all of the works of this
period consider a knowledge graph to be formed of a set of nodes denoting entities of interest and
a set of edges denoting relations between those entities, with different entities and relations being
considered in different works. Some works add extra elements to these knowledge graphs, such as
edge weights, edge labels, or other meta-data [137]. Other trends include knowledge acquisition
from experts [124, 311, 403] and knowledge extraction from text [25, 231, 252, 476], combinations
of symbolic and inductive methods [116, 311, 436, 455], as well as the use of rules [408], ontolo-
gies [231], graph analytics [221, 264, 470], learning [116, 403, 436, 455], and so forth. Later papers
(2008-2010) by Kasneci et al. [264], Elbassuoni et al. [137], Coursey and Mihalcea [102] and Corby
and Faron-Zucker [97] introduce notions of knowledge graph similar to current practice.

However, some trends are not reflected in current practice. Of particular note, quite a lot of
the knowledge graphs defined in this period consider edges as denoting a form of dependence or
causality, where ()}—>() may denote that x is a prerequisite for y [257, 316, 440] or that x leads to
y [25, 257, 311, 403, 408, 455]. In some cases AND-oR graphs are used to denote conjunctions or
disjunctions of such relations [311], while in other cases edges are weighted to assign a belief to a
relation [257, 311, 403]. In addition, papers from 1970-2000 tend to have worked with small graphs,
which contrasts with modern practice where knowledge graphs can reach scales of millions or
billions of nodes [365]: during this period, computational resources were more limited [440], and
fewer sources of structured data were readily available meaning that the knowledge graphs were
often sourced solely from human experts [124, 311, 403] or from text [25, 231, 252, 476].
