The number of vertices of a graph is indeed chosen randomly according to binomial distribution of
parameters n = 50 and p,, = 0.9.

5 Stone-Weierstrass theorem with symmetries

This section presents our extension of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem dealing with functions with
symmetries. The scope of this section is not restricted to graphs or even tensors and we will deal
with general spaces and general symmetries. To illustrate it, we will present applications for the
PointNet architecture Qi et al. [2017]. Our approximation results for GNNs are then obtained from
these theoretical results applied to tensors and the symmetric group.

5.1 General notations

As explained above, we are dealing in this section with a much larger scope than graphs and
permutations. We first need to extend the notations introduced above. The notations introduced below
will make this section self-contained.

If X is some topological space, and F C X, denote by F its closure.

If X is a topological space and Y = R? some finite-dimensional space, denote by C(X, Y) the set of
continuous functions from X to Y.

Moreover, if X is compact, we endow C(.X, Y) with the topology of uniform convergence, which is
defined by the norm, f ++ sup,.¢x ||f(«)|| for some norm ||.|| on Y.

If G is a finite group acting on some topological space X, we say that G acts continuously on X if,
for all g € G, x + g- x is continuous.

If G is a finite group acting on some compact X and some topological space Y, we define the sets of
equivariant and invariant continuous functions by,

Ce(X,Y) ={f €C(X,Y) Wa e X, Vg EG, f(g- 2) = 9: f(x)}
Cr(X,Y) ={f €C(X,Y) : Vr € X, V9 € G, f(g: 2) = f(x)}

Note that these definitions extend Definition | to a general group.
