5. If F is equivariant w.rt. the action described in Cor. 22, so is E(F).

Proof. Define,
E(F) = {a 6 (m(f(x)1),.--,m(F(@)n)) : f € Fo NC(X,R"), me C(R",F), kh > 1}.
As MLP are continuous and by the universality of MLP on a compact set (see §C.1),
FOAF) CF:
This already implies 1. and that p (F) C p(E(F)) C p(F). Using Lem. 13 yields 2.

We now show 3. Take h € C(F?,F), f,g € Fo, f € C(X,R"’), g € C(X, R"2) and m € C(R”’, F),
1€C(R"s,F). All we have to det is that,

ars (Rim(f(2)1), Ug(a)1)),--+h(m(f(@)n), U(G(@)n))) € EF) -

But as Fo is stable by concatenation, z ++ (f(x), g(x)) € R'#t"s is still in Fo. Moreover,
y EReeths vy h(m(yr,- <5 Yny)s UYng-+1s «+++ Yhy-+hy) is also in C(R"# +s, F) which shows that
the map above is indeed in €(F). The last two points are immediate consequences of the definition

of E(F).

 

 

 

 

We start with the invariant case.

Corollary 21. Let X be a compact space, Y = F = R? be some finite-dimensional vector space,
G be a finite group acting (continuously) on X and F C C1(X,Y) a (non-empty) set of invariant
functions.

Assume that, for any h € C(F?,F) and f,g € F,

a+ A(F(x),9(2)) €F

Then the closure of F is, _
F={f €C(X,Y): pr C py}.

Proof. We want to apply Cor. 10. Clearly the first and the third assumptions are satisfied. All we
need to show is that the set of functions Fyca; C C(X, R) defined by,

Fecat = {f € C(X,R): fle F}
satisfy,

PF scat © PF +
Take (x,y) ¢ py and we show that (x,y) ¢ py. Indeed, by definition there exists f € F,
i e€ {l,..., ae such that f(x); # f(y)i. Let h € C(F,F) defined by, for z € F, h(z) =
(h(z)i,..-,h(z)i). Then, by assumption ho f. But ho f is of the form . with 1 € C(X,R),
and by definition, 1 € Fecat. Moreover, ho f(x) # ho f(y) so that I(x) # I(y). Therefore,
(2,y) ¢ PF reat

Thus, we can apply Cor. 10 which yields the result.

  

 

 

 

 

In our previous version of our approximation result for node embedding, we did not allow features
in the output as it would have made the statement and the proof a bit convoluted. With this new
assumption, this is much easier.
