A.5_ Particular case: node embedding

If Y = R” and G = S,, the permutation group, the description of F(x) can be simplified further.
Actually, though the idea of its proof will appear again later, this result in itself will not be used.
We will indeed need a version of this result allowing for node features in the output. However, we
encourage the reader to go through the proof for this corollary before reading the proofs of the next
sections. The proof of Cor. 19 indeed uses some of the ideas as the proof below but in a more intricate
setting.

Corollary 19. Under the assumptions of Thm. 11, and if in addition, Y = R" and G = S,, acting
on R" by, fora € Sp, x € R",

Vi € {1,...,p}, (0-2): = fo-104) ,
Then the closure of F (for the topology of uniform convergence) is,
F = {f €Coq(X,Y) : oF) C o(f)} -

Proof. All we have to show is that, if h € Ceq(X,Y) such that p(F) C p(h), then for any 1 € X,
h(a) € F(a). By Thm. 11, F (2) is of the form,

F(x) = {y € RP: Vi,j) € T(x), wi = yy},
with I(x) is given by,

I(x) = {(4,9) € {1,..., py: Vy € F(x), yi = yj} -
Take h € Ceg(X,Y) such that p(F) C p(h) and fix « € X. Our goal is to show that, for any
(i,j) € I(x), h(x); = h(x); so that h(x) € F(x). But, if (i,j) € I(x), then for any f € F,
f(x); = f(x); so that (i 7) - f(x) = f(x), where (i 7) denotes the permutation which exchanges 7
and j. Moreover, as (i j) € S, = G, by equivariance, this means that f((i 7) - x) = f(x) for every
f € F and therefore that ((¢ j)-2,x) € p(F). By assumption, we infer that ((i 7) -x,2) € p(h) too,
ie. that h(i j) + x) = h(a) and so that h(x); = h(x); by equivariance, which concludes our proof.

 

 

 

 

A.6_ A practical reduction for the two particular cases

Though the results we proved above were formulated using classic hypotheses, such as requiring F
to be a subalgebra, we can give much more compact versions for our setting. We also reduce the
assumption that p(F sca) C p(m o F) to a more practical one.

We start with a lemma explaining our interest in the new formulation. This lemma describes a general
property of classes of GNN which end with a MLP.

Lemma 20. Fix X some compact space, n > 1 and F a finite-dimensional feature space. Let
Fo C Up. C(X, R") be stable by concatenation and consider,

F ={x- (m(f(x)1),---,m(f(@)n)) : f € Fone(X,R"), m:R" + FMLP, h > 1} C C(X,F).

Then, if E(F) © C(X, F) is the set of functions obtained by replacing the MLP m in the definition of
F by an arbitrary continuous function, E(F) satisfies,

1. F=€(F)
2. p(F) = p(E(F))
3. For any h € C(F?,F), f,g € E(F),
ary (h(f(a)1,9(@)1),-+- MF (@)ns 9(@)n)) € E(F)-
4. If, for any f € F,

n

rH (= FlenS> Heh Feo) EF,
i=1 t=1

i=l
then, for any f € E(F),

rH (= f(a) So f@)i-- “Yse) €E(F).
i=l i=l i=1
