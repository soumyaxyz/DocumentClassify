* (maximum) independent set: an independent set is a set of nodes in a graph no two of which are
adjacent. The maximum independent set problem entails finding the independent set of
maximum cardinality.

* (minimum) vertex cover: a vertex cover of G is a set of nodes such that each edge of G is incident
to at least one node in the set. The minimum vertex cover problem entails finding the vertex
cover of minimum cardinality.

* (perfect) coloring: a coloring of G is a labeling of the nodes with distinct colors such that no two
adjacent nodes are colored using same color. The perfect coloring problem entails finding a
coloring with the smallest number of colors.

* diameter: the diameter dg of G equals the length of the longest shortest path.
* girth: the girth of G equals the length of the shortest cycle. It is infinity if no cycles are present.

B_ DEFERRED PROOFS

B.1 PROOF OF THEOREMB. 1]

The claim is proven by expressing the state of node v; in the two models in the same form. It is not
difficult to see that for each layer of the GNNf,, one has

a? = Ur( > m{2,) (by definition)
ujEN;F
= UPe( > MsGy (of, 2, v4, Uys aie) ) (substituted m5)
vj ENS

= AGGy ({ (20? 2, wi, v5; aici) 1uj € Ni}) , (from 2018] Lemma 5))

where AGG, is an aggregation function, i.e., a map from the set of multisets onto some vector space.
In the last step, I used a result of Xu et al. (2018) stating that each aggregation function
can be decomposed as an element-wise function over each element of the multiset, followed by
summation of all elements, and then a final function.

Similarly, one may write:

3 = ALG; ({ (sor din) ray € Nj} ; vi) (by definition)
= ALG} ({ (Ats?_, (sf, »,) ; aij) 2u¢€ Nv} ; vi) (substituted so)

= ALG, ({(sf,w, Uj, ai) :vj € N;}) :

with the last step following by restructuring the input and defining ALG, as the Turning machine that
simulates the action of both ALG? and ALG}_.

Since one may encode any vector into a string and vice versa, w.l.o.g. one may assume that the state
of each node in LOCAL is encoded as a vector x;. Then, to complete the proof, one still needs to
demonstrate that the functions

AGG ({(2;,2j, Vi, Vj, Giz) 10; ENJ}) and ALG({(xj, vi, vj, aij) vj € Ni})

are equivalent (in the interest of brevity the layer/round indices have been dropped). If this holds then
each layer of GNNfjp is equivalent to a round of LOCAL and the claim follows.

I first note that, since its input is a multiset, ALG, is also an aggregation function. To demon-
strate equivalence, one thus needs to show that, despite not having identical inputs, each of the
two aggregation functions can be used to replace the other. For the forward direction, it suffices to
show that for every aggregation function AGG there exists ALG with the same output. Indeed, one
may always construct ALG = AGG 0 g, where g takes as input {(x;, vi, vj, @icj) 10; ENF},
identifies x; (by searching for v;, v;) and appends it to each element of the multiset yielding
{(xj,@j, Vi, Vj, Gigj) 1 Vj € Nj*}. The backward direction can also be proven with an elementary
construction: given ALG, one sets AGG = ALG oh, where h deletes x; from each element of the
multiset.
