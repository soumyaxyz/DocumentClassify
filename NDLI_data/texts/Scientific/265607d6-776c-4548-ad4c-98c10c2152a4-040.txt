term weights w,q (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009). This simplification makes the
estimation of the probability of relevance tractable, by assuming independence
among the query terms conditioned on the observation of relevant (and non-
relevant) documents. To estimate the individual term weights, there have been
two major directions, depending on whether the presence or the actual frequency
of terms in a document is considered. The resulting models, respectively, binary

independence and best matching, are discussed next.

Binary Independence Model One of the first instantiations of the PRP was
the binary independence model (BIM; Robertson & Sparck Jones, 1976). This
model assumes a presence-absence scenario, where absence is the complementary
event to presence. Under this assumption, ¢f,, is a binary variable, denoting
whether or not the term ¢ occurs in the document d. It is further assumed
that tf, provides evidence of the relevance of the document d for the term f,
independently of other terms. The general formulation of the PRP under these

particular assumptions leads to the following definition:

Pl tha |Ga) (1 = PUtha Ga)

IM __
hd = 18 a Ga) than)” 27)

where G, is the relevance set for q and tf, , is either 0 or 1. In the presence of
actual relevance data (e.g., from the user’s feedback), replacing the probabili-
ties in Equation (2.7) with their equivalent proportions leads to the well-known
Robertson / Sparck Jones (RSJ) formula (Robertson & Sparck Jones, 1976):

PS) (nf + 0.5)(n — n* — my + nf + 0.5)
wa = lo % '
, (rm — nf + 0.5)(n* — nf + 0.5)

 

, (2.8)

where 7m is the total number of documents in the corpus that contain the term t,
nj is the number of such documents that were judged relevant, and n* is the total
number of documents judged relevant. The introduced factor of 0.5 makes the
resulting estimation more robust compared to using a simple ratio (Robertson
& Sparck Jones, 1976). In a usual scenario, in the absence of relevance data,
n* = nj = 0, in which case the individual term weights in Equation (2.8) closely

approximate the idf formulation in Equation (2.1).
