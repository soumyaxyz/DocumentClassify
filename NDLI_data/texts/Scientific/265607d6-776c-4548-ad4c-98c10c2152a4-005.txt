Acknowledgements

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to several people for their

immense support during the course of my PhD.

First of all, I am extremely grateful to my family for the continued
and unconditional encouragement and for helping me manage my life

in two different countries over the past four years.

A great deal of gratitude is due to my supervisor, Iadh Ounis. His
ambitious and critical view helped shape not only an outstanding
thesis, but also my path towards a promising research career. I am also
grateful to Craig Macdonald, for co-supervising the development of

this thesis, and for collaborating in various other research endeavours.

I must also thank my colleagues at the Terrier team for our collabora-
ion over the past four years: Ben He, Jie Peng, Richard McCreadie,

Nut Limsopatham, Dyaa Albakour, and Eugene Kharitonov.

I am also thankful to David Manlove for his courteous and punc-
tual encouragement over the course of my PhD, to Mark Girolami
for our fruitful discussions regarding the probabilistic interpretation
of the xQuAD framework at an early stage of its development, to
he several anonymous reviewers who refereed this work in its vari-

ous publications, and to Charles Clarke and Leif Azzopardi for their

 

thoughtful feedback during my PhD viva.

Last but foremost, I am specially grateful to my wife-to-be, for her
incommensurable support at every single moment of this endeavour,

and for shortening over 6,000 miles between us with immense love.
