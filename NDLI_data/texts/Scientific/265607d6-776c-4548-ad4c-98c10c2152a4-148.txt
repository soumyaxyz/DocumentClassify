To this end, we leverage multiple query-dependent ranking approaches, including
standard weighting models, such as BM25 (Equation (2.13)), language modelling
with Dirichlet smoothing (LM; Equation (2.25)), the DFR DPH (Equation (2.31))
and PL2 (Equation (2.29)) models, and a simple coordination level matching
(CLM; Equation (2.5)). Additionally, we use term dependence models based
on Markov Random Fields (MRF; Equation (2.20)) and the DFR framework
(pBiL; Equation (2.32)), which highly score suggestions where the query terms
co-occur in close proximity. All query-dependent features are efficiently computed
at querying time with a single pass over the posting lists for the query gq in the
index of structured virtual documents (Macdonald, Santos & Ounis, 2013).

As for the query-independent features, they are all computed at indexing

time. In particular, we consider features that can be directly estimated from the
