3. Search Result Diversification

 

Another test collection for the evaluation of web search result diversification
was recently introduced as part of the NTCIR-9 Intent task (Song et al., 2011a).°
Initiated in 1999, NTCIR is a series of evaluation workshops designed to assess
information retrieval on Asian languages, as well as across different languages. For
the NTCIR-9 Intent task, two test collections were developed, aimed at evaluating
search result diversification on the Chinese and the Japanese Web. In particular,
the Chinese collection comprised 100 topics, with 4 to 15 associated aspects each.
For Japanese, another 100 topics were developed, each with 3 to 22 aspects. An

example Chinese topic (translated to English) is shown in Figure 3.4.

Different from the diversity task of the TREC 2009-2011 Web tracks, the
NTCIR-9 Intent task included graded (i.e., non-binary) relevance assessments
at the aspect level. In addition, as shown in Figure 3.4, the identified aspects
were assigned non-uniform probabilities, estimated through assessor agreement,
in order to place more emphasis on popular aspects during the evaluation (Sakai
& Song, 2012). While these extensions certainly introduce interesting nuances for
diversity evaluation, in order to ensure a consistently uniform experimental setup
throughout this thesis, we opted not to use these test collections. Nonetheless,
an evaluation of the framework introduced in this thesis on both NTCIR-9 Intent

task test collections was conducted by Santos et al. (2011f).

The NTCIR-10 Intent task is also ongoing at the time of writing.
