Tokenization and Unification. It is done to get sub-formula or sub-expression
and to remove insignificant data. During variable unification, all variables in the
expressions are replaced by unified symbols (ids) in both indexing and searching
phase so those expressions with same semantic meaning but with different vari-
ables would match. For example after variable unification expression like x + y*
and a + b* will be id; + idi#. Moreover, like variable unification constants are
also replaced by a unified symbol.

The European Digital Mathematics Library EuDML was created by a con-
sortium of 15 partners from 9 countries in frames of a project partly funded by
the European Commission in the EC Competitiveness and Innovation Frame-
work Programme, Information and Communication Technology Policy Support
Programme, in the period from 1 February 2010 to 31 January 2013.

The EuDML provides a free access to a large volume of scholarly mathemat-
ical literature including the content of the Czech Digital Mathematics Library
DML-CZ. Scientific journals and articles are included in Eu-DML as shown in
Fig. 4. Currently 260413 documents across 14 collections are searchable. Of those,
223,723 full-texts are indexed and 13,269 were made accessible to print disabled
users [14, 18, 29].

3.8 SearchOnMath

The first version of SearchOnMath was released in 2013. Later on, it had become
a start-up by the end of 2015 and consequently a part of Microsoft BizSpark
