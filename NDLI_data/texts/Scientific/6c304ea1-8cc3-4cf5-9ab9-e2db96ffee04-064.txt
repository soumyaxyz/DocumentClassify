Fig. 33. Two example Linked Data documents from two websites, each containing an RDF graph, where
wd:Q142701 refers to Pearl Jam in Wikidata while wdd:Q142701 to the RDF graph about Pearl Jam, and
where wd: Q221535 refers to Eddie Vedder while wdd:Q221535 refers to the RDF graph about Eddie Vedder;
the edge-label wdt:571 refers to “inception” in Wikidata, while wdt:527 refers to “has part”

o R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

In the context of knowledge graphs, a variety of vocabularies, tools, and services have been
proposed that both directly and indirectly help to satisfy the FAIR principles. In terms of Findability,
as discussed in Section 2, IRIs are built into the RDF model, providing a general schema for global
identifiers. In addition, resources such as the Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) [9] allow
for representing meta-data about graphs, while services such as DataHub [41] provide a central
repository of such dataset descriptions. Access protocols that enable Accessibility will be discussed
in Section 9.2, while mechanisms for authorisation will be discussed in Section 9.3. With respect to
Interoperability, as discussed in Section 4, ontologies serve as a general knowledge representation
formalism, and can in turn be used to describe vocabularies that follow FAIR principles. Finally,
regarding Reusability, licensing will be discussed in Section 9.3, while the PROV Data Model [181]
discussed in Section 3 allows for capturing detailed provenance.

A number of knowledge graphs have been published using FAIR principles, where Wilkinson
et al. [524] explicitly mention Open PHACTS [193], a data integration platform for drug discovery,
and UniProt [492], a large collection of protein sequence and annotation data, as conforming to
FAIR principles. Both datasets offer graph views of their content through the RDF data model.

9.1.2 Linked Data Principles. Wilkinson et al. [524] state that FAIR Principles “precede implemen-
tation choices”, meaning that the principles do not cover how they can or should be achieved.
Preceding the FAIR Principles by almost a decade are the Linked Data Principles, proposed by
Berners-Lee [37], which provide a technical basis for one possible way in which these FAIR Princi-
ples can be achieved. Specifically the Linked Data Principles are as follows:

(1) Use IRIs as names for things.

(2) Use HTTP IRIs so those names can be looked up.

(3) When a HTTP IRI is looked up, provide useful content about the entity that the IRI names
using standard data formats.

(4) Include links to the IRIs of related entities in the content returned.

These principles were proposed in a Semantic Web setting, where for principle (3), the standards
based on RDF (including RDFS, OWL, etc.) are currently recommended for use, particularly because
they allow for naming entities using HTTP IRIs, which further paves the way for satisfying all four
principles. As such, these principles outline a way in which (RDF) graph-structured data can be
published on the Web such that these graphs are interlinked to form what Berners-Lee [37] calls a
“Web of Data”, whose goal is to increase automation on the Web by making content available not
