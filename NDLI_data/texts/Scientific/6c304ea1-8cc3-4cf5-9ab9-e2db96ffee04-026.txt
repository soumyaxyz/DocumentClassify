features for defining novel classes by applying set operators on other classes, or based on conditions
that the properties of its instances satisfy. First, using set operators, one can define a novel class
as the complement of another class, the union or intersection of a list (of arbitrary length) of other
classes, or as an enumeration of all of its instances. Second, by placing restrictions on a particular
property p, one can define classes whose instances are all of the entities that have: some value from
a given class on p; all values from a given class on p;'° have a specific individual as a value on p (has
value); have themselves as a reflexive value on p (has self); have at least, at most or exactly some
number of values on p (cardinality); and have at least, at most or exactly some number of values on
p from a given class (qualified cardinality). For the latter two cases, in Table 4, we use the notation
¢}” to count distinct entities satisfying ¢ in the interpretation. These features can then be
combined to create more complex classes, where combining the examples for INTERSECTION and
Has SELF in Table 4 gives the definition: self-driving taxis are taxis having themselves as a driver.

 

15While something like (flight) prop—DomesticAirport)—all-»(NationalFlight) might appear to be a more natural example for

Aut Vatugs, this would be a modelling mistake, as the corresponding for all condition is satisfied when no such node exists.
In other words, with this example definition, we could infer anything known not to have any flights to be a domestic airport.
(We could, however, define the intersection of this class and airport as being a domestic airport.)
