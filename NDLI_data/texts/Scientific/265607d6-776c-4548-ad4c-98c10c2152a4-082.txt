3.3.1 Novelty-based Approaches

Novelty-based approaches have the longest history in the search result diversifi-
cation literature, stemming from research on identifying novel sentences for text
summarisation (Carbonell & Goldstein, 1998). The definitional characteristic of
such approaches is their account for dependences between the ranked documents,
and consequently their strict adherence to the formulation in Algorithm 3.1.
The novelty-based diversification approaches in the literature typically dif-
fer according to their estimation of document dependence. As highlighted in
Table 3.1, the vast majority of these approaches adopts an implicit aspect repre-
sentation, typically comprising the space of unique terms in a document corpus.®
For such approaches, at the 7-th iteration, an evaluation of the objective function
f(q,d,D,) would have a cost @; « u(i—1), where v is the number of unique terms
~~ 87 enable the assessment of the effectiveness of novelty as a diversification strategy in

isolation from the aspect representation dimension, in Chapter 8, we introduce the first explicit
novelty-based diversification approaches in the literature.
