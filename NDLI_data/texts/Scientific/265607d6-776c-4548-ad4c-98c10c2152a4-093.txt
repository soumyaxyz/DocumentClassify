3. Search Result Diversification

 

Analogously to the instantiation of diversification approaches, discussed in
Section 3.3, diversity evaluation is typically operationalised by representing the
possible information needs underlying a query as multiple query aspects.!! Early
attempts to build a test collection for diversity evaluation were made at the TREC
6-8 Interactive tracks (Over, 1997, 1998; Hersh & Over, 1999). The investigated
task, called “aspect retrieval”, involved finding documents covering as many dif-
ferent aspects of a given query as possible. In this evaluation campaign, a total
of 20 topics were adapted from the corresponding years of the TREC Ad hoc
tracks (Voorhees & Harman, 1997, 1998, 1999). Each topic included from 7 to 56
aspects, as identified by TREC assessors, with relevance assessments provided at
the aspect level. Figure 3.2 illustrates one of such topics, 353i, along with some

of its identified aspects, denoted “sub-topics” in the TREC jargon.

<topic number="353i">
<query> antarctic exploration </query>
<description>
Identify systematic explorations and scientific investigations of
Antarctica, current or planned.
</description>
<subtopic number="1"> mining prospection </subtopic>
<subtopic number="2"> oil resources </subtopic>
<subtopic number="3"> rhodium exploration </subtopic>
<subtopic number="4"> ozone hole / upper atmosphere </subtopic>
<subtopic number="5"> greenhouse effect </subtopic>
</topic>

By relying on expert judges to identify query aspects from the retrieved doc-
uments (Lagergren & Over, 1998), the TREC Interactive track test collection
arguably lacks in plausibility and completeness in light of the actual information
needs of the population of users issuing a query (Radlinski et al., 2010b). In
order to overcome this limitation, Radlinski et al. (2010a) proposed to identify
realistic query aspects for diversity evaluation from the query and click logs of a
commercial search engine. In their approach, candidate aspects were selected as

queries that frequently co-occurred with the initial query across multiple sessions

Note that the aspect representation adopted by a diversification approach does not neces-
sarily reflect the ground-truth aspect representation adopted for evaluation purposes.
