5.2.1 | Free Software

Table[6]presents free keyphrase extraction software along with some useful features, such as the implemented meth-
ods, supported languages and implementation language. There are software packages that include only one keyphrase
extraction method (Maui, KEA, seq2seq, TextRank, YAKE, RAKE, TopicCoRank) and others that have more than one
methods implemented (PKE - Python Keyphrase Extraction (Boudin2016), the KE package, Sequential Labeling, Cite-
TextRank). As far as the supported languages by each software concerned, RAKE supports English, French and Spanish,
TopicCorank supports English and French, KEA and Maui support English, French, German and Spanish, whereas Tex-
tRank supports additional languages, e.g., Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Italian etc. Although the default language in PKE
and YAKE is English, keyphrases can also be extracted in other languages by setting the language parameter to the

desired language.

5.2.2. | Commercial Software

As far as the commercial keyphrase extraction software concerned, to the best of our knowledge, Google Cloud Natu-
ral Language APfJhas not included a service devoted to keyphrase extraction. However, an interesting feature of this
API is the one of entity recognition which identifies entities and labels by types, such as person, organization, location,
event, product, and media. Furthermore, our empirical analysis presented in Table[7]shows that the entity recognition
feature provided by Google’s API is an alternative option, as it returns satisfactory results compared to the state-of-
the-art methods of the keyphrase extraction task. In the same direction, the TextRazor APPoffers entity recognition
service that besides the classic confidence score (confidence related to the validity of the returned entity), it also gives
the relevance score, which shows the relevance of the returned entity to the source text. Microsoft offers its com-
mercial software for keyphrase extraction via Microsoft's Text Analytics Apif] Moreover, Aylien Text Analysis AP[’]
performs a variety of complex NLP tasks on documents including keyphrase extraction, whereas, IBM and Amazon of-
fer their commercial solutions for advanced text analysis as well as keyphrase extraction via Watson Natural Language
Understanding APB] and the Comprehend APP]

Googlq®] TextRazor!t 1BM™] and Microsoft Text Analytic{!]APIs have a wide range of supported languages,

however, Amazon Comprehend API performs direct text analysis only on English and Spanish texts. Particularly, Ama-

 

zon Comprehend proposes the conversion of the text of an unsupported language to English or Spanish via the Amazon

 

Translate, and then uses Amazon Comprehend to perform text analysis. Finally, the Aylien Text Analysig
ports the following 6 languages regarding the keyphrase extraction feature: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish
and Portuguese.

Table[7]shows the performance of the commercial APIs discussed above on 5 popular datasets of

the task. We should note that this empirical study is conducted in the context of the survey on the task using very
