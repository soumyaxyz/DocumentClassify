2. Web Information Retrieval

 

Additional readability features have been recently proposed by Bendersky
et al. (2011). For instance, they proposed to use the entropy H(4,) of a document’s

language model 6, as a measure of topic cohesiveness (TC), according to:

fro(q,d) = H(6a) = — )> p(t|d) log p(t|d), (2.37)

ted

where p(t|d) was computed using a maximum likelihood estimation, as described
in Equation (2.23). Other readability features proposed by Bendersky et al.
(2011) include the document’s fraction (SF) and coverage (SC) of stopwords,
computed as the ratio of terms in the document that are stopwords and the ratio

of all stopwords that are covered in the document, respectively, according to:

[{t; € d} N Y,|

fe(4, 4) = th < dj] (2.38)
koa.) = aoe (2.39)

where Y, is a list of stopwords. Both SF and SC are intended as simple estimators
of the divergence between the document and the corpus language models, and are
positively correlated with the document informativeness (Zhou & Croft, 2005).
Another readability feature used in the experimental part of this thesis is the
fraction of terms in the document that appear in tables. The underlying intuition
here is that documents comprising mostly tabular content are less readable. Let
Ta comprise the textual content appearing within tables in the document d. The
table text (TT) feature (Bendersky et al., 2011) can be estimated according to:

At the lower end of the quality spectrum, the Web is severely affected by
spam. Spam documents typically include automatically generated content tar-
geting popular search queries, or even human-generated content plagiarised from
legitimate sources, so as to deceive search engines and attract larger audiences,
which can ultimately result in increased advertisement revenue for the spam-

mer (Castillo & Davison, 2011). In particular, spam documents typically have
