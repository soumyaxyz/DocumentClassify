5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have described a probabilistic model for
entity linking on web search queries. This task already poses
numerous challenges by itself but a major limitation in the
context of web search is that we are heavily constrained from
a runtime perspective, imposing time and space requirements
whilst maintaining accuracy. Our method leverages informa-
tion from query logs and anchor texts to automatically obtain
a large number of aliases for the entities in a knowledge base
and uses a probabilistic model to rank entities in query seg-
ments. Our model uses dynamic programming to generate
the best entity segmentation and, in order to add information
about the query context into the ranking, we devise a novel
way of aggregating vectors that encode word distributional
semantics. This new contextual vector model significantly
outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines from the liter-
ature on a public test set comprised of 2.5K queries, while
being able to provide sub-millisecond response timesâ€”several
orders of magnitude faster than entity linking systems from
the literature.

Furthermore, all the data structures used by our system
are compressed using state-of-the-art hashing, quantization,
and integer encoding techniques. This yields a final data-pack
storing hundreds of millions of aliases for all 4.6M Wikipedia
entities using less than 2GB of storage. We also note that
the size of the word vector representations can be reduced
by an order of magnitude without any execution overhead.

For future work, we would like to test the scalability of
the system when considering hundreds of millions of entities
and billions of aliases. This might require to employ static
pruning algorithms to reduce the size of the compressed data
structures [4]. Additionally, we generated the contextual vec-
tors using Wikipedia but we could expand the input sources
to accommodate for other types of data, such as queries or
news, which could incorporate more interesting contextual

relations that fall outside of encyclopedic knowledge (e.g.,
trends, gossip, etc.). Another interesting line of work could
involve incorporating session-level features into the entity
linking process in order to make use of a richer source of con-
textual information. Finally, we believe that our contextual
entity models are general enough to be of value in different
types of applications that make use of word aggregation
distributional similarities.
