Finally, the differences between manual and average matching F,-scores have a slightly higher median/mean but more
concentrated range of values around zero, compared to the rest types of differences (Exact, Partial). Figure[6](see
Appendix{D], shows an alternative view of the differences between the F, -score values based on the manual evaluation
and the F;-score values calculated according to the exact (solid line), partial (dashed line) and average (dotted line)

evaluation approaches for KPM and MR methods.

Our analysis suggests that researchers should consider the average of exact and partial matching for empirical
