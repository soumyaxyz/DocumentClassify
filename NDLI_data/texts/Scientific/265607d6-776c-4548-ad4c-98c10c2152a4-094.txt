3. Search Result Diversification

 

in the query log. Candidates with a low transition probability after a two-step
random walk on the bipartite query-document click graph (Craswell & Szummer,
2007) were filtered out. The remaining candidates were then clustered using a
graph partitioning algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008). The highest-scoring aspects
from different clusters were shown to better reflect real user needs compared to
aspects proposed by expert judges (Radlinski et al., 2010a,b). As a result, these
aspects served as the basis for a new test collection, developed in the context of
the TREC 2009-2012 Web tracks (Clarke et al., 2009a, 2010, 2011b, 2012).

The diversity task of the TREC 2009-2012 Web tracks currently provides the
largest publicly available test collections for diversity evaluation. As of 2011,”
these test collections comprised a total of 150 topics, with 2 to 8 associated
aspects each (Clarke et al., 2009a, 2010, 2011b). As such, these collections are
chosen as benchmarks for the experiments conducted in this thesis. An example
TREC Web track topic, along with its identified aspects, is shown in Figure 3.3.
In contrast to the short description provided by the TREC Interactive track test
collection, the TREC Web track aspects include a natural language description
of the information need represented by each aspect. Moreover, each aspect is
further classified as either informational (“inf”) or navigational (“nav”) by TREC
assessors, depending on the intent of its underlying need (Broder, 2002).
