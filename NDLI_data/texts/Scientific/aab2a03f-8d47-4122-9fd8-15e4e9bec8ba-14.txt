B. Logic for the ‘Birds” Rulebase

Sergot’s original logic!? for the “birds” rulebase is as follows
(“not” denotes negation as failure, “—” denotes hard nega-
tion):

% Rules:

% If someone is a bird and not abnormal then they can fly.

can_fly(X) + bird(X), not abnormal _bird(X)

% If someone is an ostrich then they are a bird.
bird(X) < ostrich(X)

% If someone is an ostrich then they are abnormal.
abnormal_bird(X) < ostrich(X)

% If someone is an ostrich then they cannot fly.
acan_fly(X) + ostrich(X)
% If someone is a bird and wounded

% then they are abnormal.
abnormal_bird(X) < bird(X), wounded(X)

% If someone is wounded then they cannot fly.
scan_fly(X) <- wounded(X)

% And the following facts:

% Arthur is a bird and not wounded.
bird(arthur). swounded(arthur).

% Bill is an ostrich.
ostrich(bill).

% Colin is a bird and wounded.
bird(colin). wounded(colin).

% Dave is not an ostrich and wounded.
sostrich(dave). wounded(dave).

C. The “Electricity” Rulebases

The four electricity rulebases, and the scenario vocabularies,
exactly as provided to the model, are shown below:

C.1 Electricity1

Rulebase

If a circuit has a switch and the switch is on then the circuit is
complete.

If a circuit does not have a switch then the circuit is complete.
If a circuit is complete and the circuit has a light bulb then the
light bulb is glowing.

If a circuit is complete and the circuit has a bell then the bell
is ringing.

If a circuit is complete and the circuit has a radio then the
radio is playing.

Scenario Generation

A circuit has a switch. (included as a fact with p=0.5)

A switch is on. (p=0.5)

A circuit has a light bulb. | A circuit has a bell | A circuit
has a radio. (select 1)

C.2 Electricity2

Rulebase

If a circuit has a switch and the switch is on then the circuit is
complete.

If a circuit does not have a switch then the circuit is complete.
If a circuit is complete then a current runs through the circuit.
If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a light
bulb then the light bulb is glowing.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a bell
then the bell is ringing.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a radio
then the radio is playing.

Scenario Generation

A circuit has a switch. (p=0.5)

A switch is on. (p=0.5)

A circuit has a light bulb. | A circuit has a bell | A circuit
has a radio. (select 1 fact)

C.3 Electricity3

Rulebase

If a circuit has a battery then the circuit is powered.

If a circuit does not have a battery then the circuit is dead.

If a circuit is dead then a bell is not ringing.

If a circuit is dead then a radio is not playing.

If a circuit is dead then a light bulb is not glowing.

If a circuit has a switch and the switch is on then the circuit is
complete.

If a circuit does not have a switch then the circuit is complete.
If a circuit is powered and the circuit is complete then a cur-
rent runs through the circuit.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a light
bulb then the light bulb is glowing.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a bell
then the bell is ringing.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit has a radio
then the radio is playing.

Scenario Generation

A circuit has a battery. (p=0.9)

A circuit has a switch. (p=0.5)

A switch is on. (p=0.5)

A circuit has a light bulb. | A circuit has a bell | A circuit
has a radio. (select 1)

C.4 Electricity4

Rulebase

If a circuit includes a battery and the battery is not flat then
the circuit is powered.

If a circuit includes a switch and the switch is on then the cir-
cuit is complete.

If a circuit does not include a switch then the circuit is com-
plete.

If a wire is metal then the wire is conducting.

If a wire is plastic then the wire is not conducting.

If a circuit is powered and the circuit is complete and a wire
is conducting then a current runs through the circuit.

If a current runs through a circuit and the circuit includes a
light bulb then the current runs through the light bulb.
