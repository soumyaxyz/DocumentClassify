3. Search Result Diversification

 

Coverage and novelty can be combined to define the search result diversifi-
cation problem. Informally, the problem can be stated as that of producing a
ranking with maximum coverage and maximum novelty with respect to the pos-
sible information needs underlying a query, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. The figure
also contrasts a diversity-oriented ranking from a traditional relevance-oriented

ranking, which assumes that a single information need underlies the query.

Figure 3.1: Relevance-oriented ranking and the often conflicting goals of diversity-
oriented ranking, namely, to attain maximum coverage and maximum novelty.

Formally, let R, denote the ranking produced for the query q by a relevance-
oriented ranking approach, such as those described in Section 2.2. Moreover,
let MN, and NM, denote the sets of information needs for which the query g and
each document d € R, are relevant, respectively. The goal of the search result

diversification problem is to find a subset D, € 2%, such that:

D, = argmax| Useo, Ng Nal, s-t. [Di] <7, (3.1)

Dies
where 7 > 0 is the diversification cutoff, denoting the number of top documents
from R, to be diversified, and 2% is the power set of R,, comprising all subsets
Di, of Ry, with 0 < |Dj| < 7, to be considered as candidate permutations of R4.
The permutation with the maximum number of covered information needs up to

the cutoff 7 is chosen as the optimal diversified ranking Dj.
