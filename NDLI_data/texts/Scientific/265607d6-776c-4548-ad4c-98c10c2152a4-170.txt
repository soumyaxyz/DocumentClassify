7. Document Coverage

 

7.2.1 Covering Multiple Intents

Given a query q, our ultimate goal is to maximise the diversity of the retrieved
documents with respect to the multiple information needs underlying this query.
For explicit diversification approaches—such as those introduced in Section 3.3—
at the heart of this goal lies an estimation of how well each document satisfies
each of these information needs. For xQuAD, as formalised in Section 4.2.1,
this equates to estimating the probability p(d|q,s) of observing the document d
given the query q and the sub-query s. In this section, we propose a supervised
learning approach to perform this estimation, by predicting the appropriateness
of multiple intent-aware ranking models for each identified sub-query.

In order to formalise our approach, we further derive the probability p(dlq, 5),

by marginalising it over a target set of intents Z, according to:

p(dlq,s) = > plls) pldla, 8,4), (7.1)

vel

where p(z|s) is the probability that the sub-query s € S, conveys the intent v.
Accordingly, p(d\q, s,+) denotes the relevance of the document d given the query
q, the sub-query s, and the intent v. As a consequence, in order to estimate the

probability p(d|q,s), our task becomes two-fold:
1. Infer the probability p(z|s) of each intent 4 given the sub-query s;
2. Learn an intent-aware model p(d|q, s,+) for each predicted intent ¢.
In Section 7.2.2, we propose a classification approach for the first task. For

the second task, as we will show in Section 7.2.3, we resort to learning to rank.

7.2.2 Inferring Sub-Query Intents

In order to infer the probability of multiple intents for a sub-query, we propose
a linear classification approach. In particular, given a sub-query s, our goal is to

estimate the probability of an intent v € Z as:

P(t|s) = flw Xs), (7.2)
