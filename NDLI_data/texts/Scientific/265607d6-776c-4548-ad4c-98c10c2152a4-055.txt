2. Web Information Retrieval

 

was introduced to distinguish between URLs containing different components,
such as a domain name (a “root” URL), a domain followed by a subdirectory
(a “subroot” URL), a deeper directory (a “path” URL), or a filename (a “file”
URL). In particular, homepages tend to be mainly of type “root” (Kraaij et al.,

2002). Given some relevance data G, this feature can be quantified as:

_ di € G | type(ua) = type(ua,)}|

For(9: ®) = TEC | type(ua) = typelua,)}1"

(2.33)
where type(ua) defines the type of the URL ua of document d. A simpler feature,
capturing the intuition that shorter URLs are preferred is the URL depth (UD),

which counts the number of components in the document’s URL:

Suv (4 d) = | parts(ua, Ty, (2.34)

where parts(tua,‘/’) denotes the set of forward slash-separated substrings of wa,
excluding its protocol (e.g., “http://”). Yet another similar feature counts the
number of characters ¢,,, in the URL, and is denoted URL length (UL):

fur (G4) = sus - (2.35)

Another class of query-independent ranking features used in the experimental
part of this thesis exploits the textual content of each document, in order to
measure its overall readability. The underlying intuition is that documents that
are easier to read are more likely to be perceived as relevant by search users.
For instance, Kanungo & Orr (2009) investigated a series of features for the task
of generating readable document summaries to be displayed in response to a
query (Tombros & Sanderson, 1998). Of these, we use the average term length

(ATL) in a document as a simple measure of readability, according to:

ari (4 d) = = S: thea Ste (2.36)

ted

where ¢, denotes the length in characters of the term t. The intuition here is that

longer terms would reflect a more thoughtful, and hence readable writing style.
