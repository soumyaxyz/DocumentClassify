Semantic schema are typically defined for incomplete graph data, where the absence of an edge
between two nodes, such as (Via del Mar}—flight rica), does not mean that the relation does not
hold in the real world. Therefore, from the graph of Figure 1, we cannot assume that there is no
flight between Vifia del Mar and Arica. In contrast, if the Closed World Assumption (CWA) were
adopted — as is the case in many classical database systems — it would be assumed that the data
graph is a complete description of the world, thus allowing to assert with certainty that no flight
exists between the two cities. Systems that do not adopt the CWA are said to adopt the Open World
Assumption (OWA). A consequence of CWA is that the addition of an edge to the data graph may
contradict what was previously assumed to be false (due to missing information), whereas with
OWA, a statement that is proven false continues to be false with the addition of more edges.

Considering our running example, it would be unreasonable to assume that the tourism organi-
sation has complete knowledge of everything describable in its knowledge graph. However, it is
inconvenient if a system is unable to definitely answer “yes” or “no” to questions such as “is there
a flight between Arica and Vira del Mar?”, especially when the organisation is certain that it has
complete knowledge of the flights. A compromise between OWA and CWA is the Local Closed
World Assumption (LCWA), where portions of the data graph are assumed to be complete.

 

3.1.2 Validating schema. When graphs are used to represent diverse, incomplete data at large-scale,
the OWA is the most appropriate choice for a default semantics. But in some scenarios, we may
wish to guarantee that our data graph — or specific parts thereof — are in some sense “complete”.
Returning to Figure 1, for example, we may wish to ensure that all events have at least a name, a
