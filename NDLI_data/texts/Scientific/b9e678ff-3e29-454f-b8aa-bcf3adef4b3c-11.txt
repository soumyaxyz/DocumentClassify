Figure 6: The top ranked expression for ‘Jacobi polynomial’
in arXiv and zbMATH. For arXiv, 30 documents were re-
trieved with a minimum hit frequency of 7.

for retrieving MOlIs, we are able to facilitate semantic extraction
systems and semantic math taggers. Imagine such a system being
capable of identifying the term ‘Jacobi polynomial’ from the textual
context. Figure 6 shows the top relevant hits for the search query
‘Jacobi polynomial’ retrieved from zbMATH and arXiv. The results
contain several relevant and related expressions, such as the con-
straints a, 6 > —1 and the weight function for the Jacobi polynomial
(1 — x)*(1 +x), which are essential properties of this orthogonal
polynomial. Based on these retrieved MOIs, the extraction systems
can adjust its retrieved math elements to improve precision, and
semantic taggers or a tokenizer could re-organize parse trees to
more closely resemble expression trees.

6 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

In this study we showed that analyzing the frequency distribu-
tions of mathematical expressions in large scientific datasets can
provide useful insights for a variety of applications. We demon-
strated the versatility of our results by implementing prototypes
of a type-hinting system for math recommendations, an extension
of zbMATH’s search engine, and a mathematical retrieval system
to search for topic-specific MOIs. Additionally, we discussed the
potential impact and suitability in other applications, such as math
search engines, plagiarism detection systems, and semantic extrac-
tion approaches. We are confident that this project lays a foundation
for future research in the field of MathIR.

We plan on developing a web application which would provide
easy access to our frequency distributions, the MOI search engine,
and the type-hinting recommendation system. We hope that this
will further expedite related future research projects. Moreover, we

will use this web application for an online evaluation of our MOI
retrieval system. Since the level of agreement among annotators

will be predictably low, an evaluation by a large community is
desired.

In this first study, we preserved the core structure of the MATHML
data which provided insightful information for the MATHML com-
munity. However, this makes it difficult to properly merge formulae.
In future studies, we will normalize the MATHML data via MathML-
Can [9]. In addition to this normalization, we will include wildcards
for investigating distributions of formula patterns rather than exact
expressions. This will allow us to study connections between math
objects, e.g., between I'(z) and I'(x + 1). This would further improve
our recommendation system and would allow for the identification
of regions for parameters and variables in complex expressions.
