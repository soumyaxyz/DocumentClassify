6. Sub-Query Generation

 

As demonstrated in Section 6.4.2.3, another benefit of our approach is its
resilience to data sparsity. Indeed, our approach is able to produce effective
suggestions even for a previously unseen query, provided that this query shares
at least one term with relevant suggestions (or other queries related to these
suggestions) in the log. Regarding the representation of candidate suggestions,
our investigation in Section 6.4.2.4 showed that features dependent on the input
query (computed using terms from the suggestion itself, as well as those from
other queries with a common session or click with the suggestion) are the most
effective descriptors of effective suggestions, denoting the topical nature of this
task. Nevertheless, query-independent features reflecting lexical characteristics
of a suggestion (e.g., its length) or its usage history (e.g., the amount of clicks
it received across sessions) were also effective. Finally, a comprehensive analysis
in Section 6.4.2.5 showed the robustness of our proposed evaluation methodology
for quantifying suggestion effectiveness in light of missing relevance assessments.

After introducing an effective mechanism for generating sub-queries, in the
next chapter, we will discuss an effective mechanism for estimating the coverage
of each retrieved document with respect to each identified sub-query. To this
end, we will exploit the intent underlying each sub-query as a means to select the

most appropriate ranking model to perform such estimations.
