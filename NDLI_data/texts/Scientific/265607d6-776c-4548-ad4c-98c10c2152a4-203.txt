Figure 8.2: Diversification performance of novelty (x MMR), coverage (xQuAD*), and
hybrid (xQuAD) approaches as non-relevant documents are removed.

From Figure 8.2(a), we first note, as expected, that the performance of DPH
improves as non-relevant documents are removed from its ranking. What we are
interested to know, however, is whether a novelty strategy can take advantage of
these gradually improving baseline performances. Looking at MMR, we observe
that the performance of this implicit novelty-based approach is lower than that
of DPH. Moreover, the gap between MMR and DPH remains almost unaltered
as non-relevant documents are removed. A similar observation can be made for
xMMR. Although it performs above DPH, the gap between the two approaches
does not increase with the removal of non-relevant documents. Another important
observation is that the hybrid combination of coverage and novelty implemented
by xQuAD does not benefit from an improved baseline ranking when compared
to xQuAD*— indeed, the performance of these two approaches is indistinguish-
able from one another in the figure. These results are surprising, as they show
that, contrarily to the established intuition, a baseline ranking with only relevant
documents is not sufficient to improve novelty-based diversification.

To investigate what could help improve novelty as a diversification strategy,
we perform a similar simulation to the one presented in Figure 8.2(a), however
under an extreme scenario. In particular, while the diversification approaches
in Figure 8.2(a) leverage “real’ aspect-document relevance estimates (i.e., those

provided by DPH), we propose a scenario where these approaches are deployed
