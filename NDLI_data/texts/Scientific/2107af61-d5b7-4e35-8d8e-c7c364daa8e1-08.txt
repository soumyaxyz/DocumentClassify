Table 1: Classification accuracies of the compared methods on benchmark datasets. The best
performer w.r.t. the mean is highlighted with an asterisk. We perform an unpaired t-test with
asymptotic significance of 0.1 w.r.t. the best performer and highlight with boldface the ones for which
the difference is not statistically significant. 0-CLIP is the CLIP architecture without any colorings.

6.2 GRAPH PROPERTY TESTING

We now investigate the ability of CLIP to identify structural graph properties, a task which was previ-

ously used to evaluate the expressivity of graph kernels and on which the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree
kernel has been shown to fail for bounded-degree graphs (Kriege et al.||2018). The performance
of our algorithm is evaluated for the binary classification of four different structural properties: 1)
connectivity, 2) bipartiteness, 3) triangle-freeness, 4) circular skip links (Murphy et al.} 2019) (see
Appendix[E}for precise definitions of these properties) against three competitors: a) GIN, arguably the
most efficient MPNN variant yet published (2019), b) Ring-GNN, a permutation invariant
network that uses the ring of matrix addition and multiplication (2019), c) RP-GIN,
the Graph Isomorphism Network combined with Relational Pooling, as described by
(2019), which is able to distinguish certain cases of non-isomorphic regular graphs. We provide a
experimental details in Appendix[E]

Table 2: Classification accuracies of the synthetic datasets. k-RP-GIN refers to a relational pooling

averaged over k random permutations. We report Ring-GNN results from (2019).

Table 2|shows that CLIP is able to capture the structural information of connectivity, bipartiteness,
triangle-freeness and circular skip links, while MPNN variants fail to identify these graph properties.
Furthermore, we observe that CLIP outperforms RP-GIN, that was shown to provide very expressive
representations for regular graphs (Murphy et al.|[2019), even with a high number of permutations
(the equivalent of colors in their method is set to k = 16). Moreover, both for k-RP-GIN and k-CLIP,
the increase of permutations and colorings respectively lead to higher accuracies. In particular, CLIP
can capture almost perfectly the different graph properties with as little as k = 16 colorings.

7 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we showed that a simple coloring scheme can improve the expressive power of
MPNNs. Using such a coloring scheme, we extended MPNNs to create CLIP, the first universal
graph representation. Universality was proven using the novel concept of separable neural networks,
