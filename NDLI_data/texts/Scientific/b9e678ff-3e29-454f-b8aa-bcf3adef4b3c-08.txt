Figure 5: Top-20 ranked expressions retrieved from a topic-specific subset of documents Dg. The search query q is given above
the plots. Retrieved formulae are annotated by a domain expert with green dots for relevant and red dots for non-relevant
hits. A line is drawn if a hit appears in both result sets. The line is colored in green when the hit was marked as relevant.

to also use TF-IDF rankings, such as a variant of BM25, to calculate
their relevance. In its original form [34], Okapi BM25 was calculated
as follows

bm2s(t,d) = (k + 1) IDF(t) TF(t, d)

where TF(t,d) is the term frequency of t in the document d,
|d| the length of the document d (in our case, the number of
subexpressions), AVGp, the average length of the documents in the
corpus (see Table 1), and IDF (t) is the inverse document frequency
of t, defined as

N-n(t)+ 3

IDF(t) := lo;
(t) = log n+

(8)
where N is the number of documents in the corpus and n(t) the
number of documents which contain the term t. By adding 3. we
avoid log 0 and division by 0. The parameters k and b are free, with
b controlling the influence of the normalized document length and
k controlling the influence of the term frequency on the final score.
For our experiments, we chose the standard value k = 1.2 anda
high impact factor of the normalized document length via b = 0.95.

As a result of our subexpression extraction algorithm, we gener-
ated a bias towards low complexities. Moreover, longer documents
generally consist of more complex expressions. As demonstrated in
Section 2.1, a document that only consists of the single expression

POP), ie., the document had a length of one, would generate
eight subexpressions, i.e., it results in a document length of eight.
Thus, we modify the BM25 score in Equation (7) to emphasize higher
complexities and longer documents. First, the average document
length is divided by the average complexity AVG, in the corpus
that is used (see Table 1), and we calculate the reciprocal of the
document length normalization to emphasize longer documents.
Moreover, in the scope of a single document, we want to empha-
size expressions that do not appear frequently in this document, but
are the most frequent among their level of complexity. Thus, less

complex expressions are ranked more highly if the document over-

all is not very complex. To achieve this weighting, we normalize

the term frequency of an expression t according to its complex-

ity c(t) and introduce an inverse term frequency according to all

expressions in the document

|d| — TE(t, d) + 5
TF(t.d) + 5

Finally, we define the score s(t, d) of a term t in a document d as

The TF-IDF ranking functions and the introduced s(t, d) are used
to retrieve relevant documents for a given search query. However,
we want to retrieve relevant subexpressions over a set of docu-
ments. Thus, we define the score of a formula (mBM25) over a set
of documents as the maximum score over all documents

mBM25(t, D) := maxs (t,d), (11)
deD

where D is a set of documents. We used Apache Flink [16] to
count the expressions and process the calculations. Thus, our im-
plemented system scales well for large corpora.

Table 2 shows the top-7 scored expressions, where D is the en-
tire zbMATH dataset. The retrieved expressions can be considered
as meaningful and real-world examples of MOIs, since most ex-
pressions are known for specific mathematical concepts, such as
