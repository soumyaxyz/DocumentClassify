to announce the re-accred-
itation result of Bharathida-
san University on September

A NAAC peer team visited
the university recently to
validate the self-study report
presented by the university.

Over a three-day duration,
he team visited various de-
artments and schools and

 
 
 
   
 

interacted with heads, stu-
dents and non-teaching staff.

The team studied curric-
ular aspects; teaching, learn-
ing and evaluation; research,
consultancy and. extension;
infrastructure and learning;
student support and progres-
sion; governance and leader-

ship; and ~ innovative
practices.

With a focus on internal
quality, the NAAC also

looked for intangible quali-
ties: number of books in li-
brary, gender-neutrality of
the programmes, and envi-

the campus this time.

The main thrust was on re-
search and innovation as
well as weightages on aspects
such as grants to research
faculty.

expressed satisfaction over
the progress made on re-
search front, the university
was not able to explain con-
vincingly the reason why vi-
tal posts such as Registrar,
