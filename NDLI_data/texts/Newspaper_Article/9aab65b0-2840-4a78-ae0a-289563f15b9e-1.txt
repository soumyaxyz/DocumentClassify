TIRUCHI: Women should be ec-
onomically independent and
this will enable them to get
self-confidence, said K.Mee-
na, Vice-Chancellor of Bha-
rathidasan University, here
on Tuesday.

Addressing the Interna-
tional Women’s Day celebra-
tions organised by the
women’s associations in Ti-
ruchi city and Shrimati Indira
Gandhi College, the Vice-
Chancellor said that women
were playing a major role in
the overall development of
society.

She pointed out that wom-
en should gain self-confi-
dence and meet the

challenges of life head-on.
The Bharathidasan Universi-
ty has introduced a number of
courses and women could
pursue their higher education
from home and involve them-
selves actively in research
and development, she said.

The Vice-Chancellor
pointed out that woman had
more responsibilities besides
being a home-maker.

She stressed the need for
co-operation among women
and requested them to strive
hard for the development of
women in the society.

Actor Radhika Sarathku-
mar in her special address
said that the women should
take special efforts to achieve
their goal.

 

She felt that there was sub-
stantial development of
women in the country and
pointed out that the women
would get true freedom only
if they were free from various
harassments.

Mrs.Radhika, who is also
the chairperson of Radaan
Media Works India Limited,
said that she believed in
equality and self-respect and
pointed out that though she
was not a feminist, women
should be allowed to take in-
dependent decisions. Wom-
en’s education is vital for the
development of the society,
she said.

Mayor S.Sujatha who pres-
ided over the function, said
