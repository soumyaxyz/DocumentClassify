THE HINDU, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 1958.

The layout of the Research Labo-

rai can broadly be classified

into the following sections: Spec-

SCR Microscopy, Optics and
~Rays.

MICROSCOPY SECTION

By far the best equipped section
of the laboratory is the one devoted
to Microscopy. On entering, one
finds oneself surrounded on all
sides by a collection of the finest
instruments the manufacturers have
to offer. Optical, binocular, mine-
ralogical, metallographic and phase
contrast microscopes vie with each
other in presenting the eager eye
of the microscopist with a of
colour and beauty and food for
thought. The X-Ray laboratory is
well provided with X-Ray genera-
tors and cameras. Recently some
important investigations have been
undertaken in X-Ray optics and in
the study of the structure of certhin

minerals. Other sections have va-
rious instruments used in different
kinds of optical, m: 5 1 and
electronic investigations. An adja-
tent building houses a workshop
adequate for the construction for
appliances necessary for research,
as also a small chemical labora-
tory.

LIBRARY AND MUSEUM

The brary forms a vital part of
the Institute and consists of a su-
rb collection on all scientific sub-
Fects, the section on physica being
perhaps the finest in the country,
A considerable number of these
books have been contributed by Ra-
man from his personal collection;
amongst which may be found many
a rare specimen, Particular men-
tion may be made of certain mar-
vellous volumes on minerals and
jewels, richly Wustrated In exqul-
aite colour. Over a hundred scien:
tific periodicals r the latest
advances in science over the
world fiow in regularly. Adjacent
to the library is lecture theatre
designed to seat up to two hundred
rsons, and intended for the hold-
fe of seminars and meetings of the
Indian Academy of Sciences.
Certainly the most impressive
spectacle that greets the eye of the
casual visitor to the Institute is the
ifcent collection of exhibits
that adorn the glass-lined shelves
on the walls of the museum. Mir-
ror backed show cases contain rocks
and stones of every le and co-
jour, minerals of every hue and tint,
crystals of every sheen and lustre
and gems of every form and fre.

beryls and many more such mira-
cles of nature, that offer a veritable
feast for the eyes. The sky-blue

visit to the museum worth while.

tural history museum.

LUMINESCENT MINERALS

The climax, however, arrives|:
with your entry into the lumines-
cent minerals room. Words cannot
describe the wonder and amaze-
ment felt at the transformation of
a number â€˜of dull and plain-look-
ing lumps of rock under the infu-
ence of the ultra violet dene in
otherwise complete darkness, You
perceive a breathtaking blaze of

ory, dormant embers fanned to

me, a magic carpet of colours
run riot, a come to life of Ali
Baba's fabulous cave, a liberation |
of the hidden mysteries of nature's
handiwork. You are filled with a
sense of freedom and happiness. If
such be research, the realisation
steals upon you, that every prob-
lem the true researcher under-
takes, is but a new and fresh ad-
venture. He probes senpet and
deeper into the secrets of nature
and as he surmounts each obsta-
cle, Himalayan panoramas unfold
before him, leaving him wonder-
struck at the immensity of his
ignorance. Certainly, the seeker!
after scientific truth is not the)
strange, silent and musty indivi-
dual of popular misconception,
who prefers to work in darkened
rooms--rather he is a vital per-
scnality with a keen and highly

 

beauty.
