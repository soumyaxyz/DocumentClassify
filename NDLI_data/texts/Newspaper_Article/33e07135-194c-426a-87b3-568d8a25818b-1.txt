Raman full authority to do every-
thing necessary to bring it into ex-

istence, as also to organise and lark

direct the activities of the Insti-
tute when completed. These heavy
responsibilities were shouldered by
him and after some years of pa-
tient work, he has been able to es-
tablish on a sound footing an Insti-
tute which has been unanimously
named after him. To him personal-
ly, it marks the culmination of a
life-long desire to create an insti-
tution which will harbour the
highest aims and ideals in science,
devoted primarily to the  ad-
vancement and poputarisation cf
scientific knowledge in India
somewhat on the lines of the
Royal Institution in England. He
is being helped in this endeavour
by a small group of enthusiastic
young men who have been attract-
ed to the institute from all over
the country. In less than
years of active functioning, signi-
ficant contributions have already
been made by him and his colla-
borators to crystal physics, crystal
optics and mineralogy.

layout of the place. The details re-
