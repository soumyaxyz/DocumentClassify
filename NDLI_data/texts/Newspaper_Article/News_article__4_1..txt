New Delhi: Taking serious
note of reports that workers
engaged in construction work
for the Commonwealth Games
were not getting their dues, the
Delhi High Court (HC) ap-
pointed on Wednesday a four-
member committee to look
into the alleged violation of
labour laws.

“You are in so much hurry
(to complete the projects), but
workers’ rights should not be
affected and it has to be taken
care of,” a bench headed by
chief justice A P Shah said
while hearing a PIL alleging
that labour laws were being
flouted by private contractors
involved in the project.

The court said it was not
possible for it to monitor the
rights of workers and consti-
tuted acommittee comprising
Delhi's labour commissioner,
labour secretary, former UN
ambassador Arundhati Ghose
and L D Mishra, who is asso-
ciated with the NHRC. The HC
asked the committee to con-
vene a meeting on Monday and
file its report by March 17,

‘The PIL, filed by civil rights
group People's Union for De-
mocratic Rights, said the Cen-
tre had failed to force private
companies to abide by labour
laws. The PIL alleged that
workers were heing housed in
“crowded hovels” with no
shield against the cold, no pow-
er and filthy or no toilets. It
urged the HC to appoint an “in-
dependent commision” to vis-
it various sites where con-
struction work is on, interview
the workers and file a report,
The petitioners sought insur-
ance cover, wage slips, paid
weekly offs, medical facilities
and workmen compensation
