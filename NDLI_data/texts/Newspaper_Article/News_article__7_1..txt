Scientist par excellence

ROFESSOR Ramanath
Peesic an astro physicist

of international repute and
winner of this year’s prestigious
Padmashree award is a scientist
par excellence. The padmashree is
another feather in the cap of the
world renowned authority on cos-
mology-particle physics and
experimental physics. However,
Professor Cowsik, has not forgot-
ten his roots and is still the deeply
compassionate human being, a
great teacher, an astute institution
builder and a person who continu-
ally inspires people.

Professor Cowsik, who has
been heading the Bangalore based
Indian Institute of Astrophysics
(IIA) since 1992, recently spoke to
Deccan Herald on a variety of
issues including his scientific con-
tribution, his concerns and aspira-
tions for science education and
research in the country.

“Awards are always welcome...
these are instances that mark the
time. I will be happy if the awards
in any way find a positive influ-
ence on the students entering into
science”, he says welcoming the
government's decision to award
him with the Padmashree.

Professor Cowsik's scientific
contributions encompass theoreti-
cal physics, experimental physics
and science management. In theo-
retical physics, his work has been
in cosmology-particle physics
interface, astrophysics and cosmic
rays. He showed that weakly inter-
acting particles like neutrinos at a
particular rest mass would domi-
nate the gravitational dynamics of
the universe, trigger the forma-
tion of galaxies and lead generi-
cally to halos of dark matter sur-
rounding these systems. This has
now become the basic paradigm
for studies of structure formation
and dark matter.

On the decline in the number
students taking to pure sciences
these days, he says “It is not a
healthy sign. Science gives a uni-
versal perspective, a much more
universal channel so that we can
come together with the rest of the
world.”

Prof Cowsik, is himself a ‘pure
science’ man throughout. He did
his BSc from the University of
Mysore in 1958. MSc in Physics
trom Karnatak University and
Phd from the University of
Mumbai in 1968. He has held vari-
vus professional position in Tata
Tnstitute ot Fundamental
Research (TIER) since 1961.

He points out that it is not the
standard of the students who take

to pure science and research that
has declined but only the num-
bers. “There is no shortage of sci-
entific institutions in the country
and today a research associate is
looked after well. The only thing
needed is motivation to encourage
and attract more students “ he
says.

“Sometimes, the senior scien-
tists themselves are to blame.
They need to be generous sharing
their ideas with the students and
encourage them. A leader in sci-
ence is one who has appreciation
of what others are doing”, he adds.
On the research front, Professor
Cowsik’s faith in Indian talent is
immense. “We may be lacking in
numbers, but not in quality”, he
says. His feels that science acade-
mies - Indian National Science
Academy, Indian Academy of
Sciences and the National
Academy of Sciences - can play a
major role in building up and also
evaluating the academic stan-
dards in the universities.

“More money should be
entrusted to the universities and

 

good research fellows should be
encouraged. In fact, the three sci-
ence academies can be entrusted
with the job of maintaining quali-
ty and the time constant here can
be around 10 years. Honest path
leads to success. Some self sacri-
fice is required but there is a great
future for India”, he says.

Prof Cowsik’s focus in astro-
physics has been primarily on par-
ticle acceleration and transport as
applied to the understanding of
radiations from energetic sources
such as quasars and supernova
remnants. In the field of cosmic
rays, he originated the leaky-box
and the nested leaky-box models
with exponential path length dis-
tributions, and these ideas are
now standard in discussing cos-
mic ray spallation and propaga-
tion.

In experiment physics,
Professor Cowsik conceived and
fabricated a torsion balance of a
new design; experiments per-
formed with this balance place an
upper bound on the strength of
any new force of macroscopic
range coupling to isospin of ~ 10-5
of gravity per amu. This balance
is currently being operated to tesi
the Principle of Equivalence at
the 10-14 level.

Most recently he explored the
great and _ trans-Himalayan
regions to establish a unique site
for Optical and’ IR astronomy in
Hanle, southeastern Ladakh, at an
altitude of 15,200 feet. A 2-m tele-
scope has been set up at this site
which is operated remotely from
the Centre for Research and
Education in Science and
Technology at Hosakote.

He has also made wide-ranging
contributions to astrophysics
through his studies of the radia-
tion transport through accretion
flows around black holes, particle
acceleration in supernova rem-
nants and their evolution as radio
sources, origin of pulsar spins and
proper motions and that of galax-
ies, just to name a few.

“There is a need for a long term
vision on science. Dedicated scien-
tists should be given an opportuni-
ty to carry on their research
beyond the superannuation age of
60 years. This will go a long way in
overcoming the present lacuna
which we are facing in R&D.
Scientists should also realise that
society is doing them a favour.
They should be obliged to the
country and should come forward
to shoulder the great responsibili-
ty”, he says.
