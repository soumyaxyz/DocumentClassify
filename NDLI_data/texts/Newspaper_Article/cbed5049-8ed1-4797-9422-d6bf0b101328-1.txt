University (BDU) has taken
the initiative to identify, col-
lect and digitise Tamil palm
leaf manuscripts (MSS),
rare books and materials
elsewhere and upload them
on the web, to provide a
single point gateway access
to these exceptional re-
sources.

A work of ancient classi-
cal Tamil literature was
documented in various
forms over the centuries.
The university has taken the
initiative to identify, collect,
organise and disseminate
the engraved information in
the scripts, using the web
technology.

The university has or-
ganised one such MSS gal-
lery for the rare palm leaf
materials 200 to 400 years
old. The university has so
far completed two search
projects. During the first
project, 26,885 palm MSS
were identified and in the

 
 
 
 
 
  
  

second project, 59,372 MSS
were identified. The MSS
contains scripts on Tamil
literature of pre-and-post
17th century.

The MSS collected from
five religious mutts and two
educational institutions
were digitalized using so-
phisticated digital photog-
raphy. The BDU has digita-
lised a set of 147 MSS and
would soon upload it on the
web for reference.

A separate website has
been created with addition-
al features for downloading
upto 98 MSS scripts, from
the palm leaf manuscripts

_ collections maintained by

various mutts, religious in-
stitutions, individuals and
educational institutions.
The links given in the
websites under various top-
ics provide access to the in-
dividual MSS images, num-
bered as individual image

files using the dynamic PHP
script. The MSS gallery also
gives access to the images,
photographs of the mutts
and the palm leaf MSS li-
braries.

The gallery can be ac-
cessed through BDU library
website and the gallery
homepage designed with
PHP script in Tamil, which
provide information about
the rare books published
between 1897 and 1935. The
gallery also has features for
downloading Tamil fonts,
uploading the scripts etc.
MSS galleries are accessed
by thousands of viewers and
feedback given by more than
4,000 users.

Department of Tamil and
School of Indian Languages,
BDU, would coordinate with
each other for the project,
particularly in identifying,
collecting and organising
palm leaf MSS, rare books,
copper plate carvings and
inscriptions about the Tam-
il society in general and the
Cauvery delta in particular.
