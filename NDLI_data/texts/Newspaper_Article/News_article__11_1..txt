CHEMISTRY NOBELS In the International Year
of Chemistry, C Sivaram charts the Nobel
prize winning achievements in the field, from
work on synthesis of sugars to vitamin

chemistry.

Chemistry. Major achievements in

chemistry are recognised every year
by way of the Nobel Prize. The very first
Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded in 1901
went to Dutch chemist Jacobus Vant Hoff
mainly for formulating laws of osmotic
pressure in solutions.

The 1902 prize went to Emil Fischer for
work on sugar chemistry leading to synthe-
sis of sugars and purines. He was a student
of Adolf Von Bayer, who himself got the
prize in 1905 for synthesis of organic dyes,
including that of the indigo dye. This proved
disastrous for the Indian indigo plant export,
which was earlier the only source for the
dye. Two other Fischers also got the chem-
istry Nobel. One was Hans Fischer, who got
itin 1930 for the constitution of chlorophyll,
use of substituted porphyrins leading to
eventual synthesis of haemin.

In 1973, Ernst Otto Fischer shared the
prize with Geoffrey Wilkinson for their in-
dependent work on organometallic ‘sand-
wich’ compounds and revolutionising tran-
sition metal chemistry with compound like
Ferrocene and those compounding rheni-
um and hydrogen or chromium with ben-
zene among others. Earlier in 1912, Grig-
nard and Paul Sabattier shared the prize
for work on organometallic compounds
(Grignard reagents etc.) This was the first
shared chemistry prize. The first eleven
prizes, including the 1911 one to Madame
Curie (for isolation of radium and poloni-
um) were given to individual chemists. The
next shared prize in chemistry was in 1929,
when Sir Arthur Harden shared with Von
Euler for work on alcoholic fermentation
of sugars. In 1935, Curie’s daughter, Irene
shared the chemistry prize with her hus-
band, Frederic, for work on artificial ra-
dioactivity, involving transmutation of alu-
minium to phosphorus. Only one other
woman chemist has got the Nobel, i.e.,
Dorothy Hodgkin in 1964 for seminal work
in unraveling the structure of complex
molecules like, insulin and Vitamin E,
through X-ray crystallography.

In 1903, Svante Arrhenius became the
first Swedish to get the Nobel for his work
on electrolytic theory of dissociation. He
was influential in the rejection of the great
Russian chemist (and founder of the peri-
od table) Mendeleev for the 1906 prize.

his year is the International Year of

Discovery of inert gases
In 1904, British chemist Sir William Ram-
sey won the prize for discovery of inert gases
in the atmosphere, like Argon, Neon, Heli-
um, Xenon, etc. In 1906, Moissan got the
prize for the discovery of Fluorine. Ernest
Rutherford got the Chemistry prize in 1908
(all the more ironic as Buchner got it in
1907 for cell fermentation). Rutherford’s
assistant Frederic Soddy won it in 1921.
Other scientists also regarded as promi-
nent physicists who got the Nobel in chem-
istry include Irving Langmuir (1932 for
his work on surface chemistry, he coined
the terms covalence and electrovalence in
his work on gas conductivity), Peter Debye
in 1936 (for screening in electrolytes) and
William Giauque in 1949 for cooling to
very low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) by adi-
abatic demagnetisation technique. Work
on surface chemistry (this time for chem-
ical reactions on surfaces) was again rec-
ognized with a Nobel to Gerhard Ertl in
2007. The other individual chemistry prize
(after 2000) was given in 2006, to Roger
Kornberg for his work on how DNA is con-
verted to RNA. His father, Arthur Korn-
berg had shared the 1959 Medicine prize
for work on biological synthesis of RNA
and DNA.

Twice lucky

Only Frederick Sanger has got the Nobel
Prize twice in chemistry, first in 1958 for
his work on structure of proteins (including
insulin) and then again in 1980, this time
jointly with Paul Berg and Walter Gilbert
for determination of nucleotide sequence
in viruses. Linus Pauling, the only person
to get two individual Nobel prizes, got the
chemistry prize in 1954 for his work on
chemical valence bonding and in 1962 the
Peace prize. While Crick, Watson and
Wilking got the medicine prize in 1962 for

MIXING IT UP The very first Nobel Prize
in Chemistry was awarded in 1901.

 

the DNA double helix model, Perutz and
Kendrew got the chemistry prize the same
year for their work on globular proteins,
thus making it an all-British affair!

The only Russian to get the chemistry
prize was Nikolai Semenov, who shared it
in 1956 with Sir Cyril Hinshelwood for
chemical chain reaction kinetics. After K
Fukui shared the chemistry prize in 1981,
with Hoffmann for chemical reaction en-
ergetic, several Japanese have shared the
Nobel chemistry prize starting from year
2000, when Hideki Shirakawa shared the
prize with Alan McDiarmid and Alan
Heeger for developing electrically con-
ducting polymers. The 2001 and 2002
prizes also had Japanese sharing the prize,
i.e., Ryogi Noyori for chiral catalysis and
Koichi Tanaka for mass spectrometric
analysis of bio-molecules, respectively. The
2010 chemistry prize was given by E
Negishi and A Suzuki sharing the prize
with Richard Hock for palladium catalysed
cross couplings in organic synthesis of
complex compounds. The 2008 prize also
had a Japanese Osamu Shimomura shar-
ing the prize with Chafie and Tsien for de-
velopment of the green fluorescent protein
(GFP) as a bioscience tag.

In 2009, the only Indian recipient of the
chemistry prize, Venkatraman Ramakr-
ishnan, shared it with Ada Yonath and
Thomas A Steitz for work on ribosomes
and protein synthesis. In 1999, Ahmed
Hasan Zewail of Egypt, won the prize for
work on femtosecond chemical reactions.
Earlier in 1967, Eigen, Norrish and Porter
also got the prize for studies of fast chem-
ical reactions.

Thermodynamics as applied to chem-
istry got Onsager the prize in 1968 (for re-
ciprocal reactions) and Ilya Prigogine in
1977 for non-equilibrium thermodynam-
ics. Otto Hahn won the prize in 1944 for
the all important nuclear fission of furani-
um, and Seaborg and McMillan for
transuranium elements in 1951. George
Hevsey (isotope tagging, 1943), Willard
Libby (Carbon-14 dating, 1960) were the
other winners.

Fritz Haber won the prize in 1918
(Haber process) and Bergius and Bosch
in 1931 (liquefaction of coal). Harold Urey
won the Nobel for heavy Hydrogen dis-
covery in 1934, Zsigmondy (1925) and
Svedberg (1926) for colloidal chemistry.
Millikan’s student, Richard Mulliken won
it in 1966 for orbital models. The study of
organic synthesis also got many prizes, in-
cluding Woodward (1965) and Natta and
Ziegler (1963).

Polymer chemistry resulted in Flory get-
ting the prize (1974) and Hermann
Staudinger in 1953. Artturi Virtanen of
Finland (1945) got the prize for agricul-
tural biochemistry and Robert Robinson
(1947) for plant products like alkaloid.

Luis Leloir in 1970, for biochemical me-
tabolism (Leloir road), G Herzberg (1971),
atomic spectroscopy, Theodore Richards
(1914) and Francis Aston (1923) for atomic
mass spectroscopy, Melvin Calvin (1961)
for analysis, Paul Karrer and Walter Ha-
worth (1937) and Richard Kuhn (1938) for
vitamin chemistry, are other notable win-
ners.
