Speaking at the inaugura-
tion of the three-day train-
ing workshop on employ-
ability skills, organised by
the department of lifelong
learning and the Lalgudi
constituent college of Bhara-
thidasan University and on
Wednesday, Balagurusamy
said a skill development
mission would be set up
across the siate to help stu-

 

denis in schools, polytech-
nics, arts and science and
engineering colleges.

“The major focus of the
mission will be on employ-
ability”, said Balagurusamy.
There was no use in just ex-
tending education opportu-
nities for students without
jurturipg any,; skills: i*
them.

During the rec ent plan-.s
ning commission’s regional
meeting, he said the prime
concentration was on em-
ployability, which was the
major objective of both par-
ents and students.

He said, nearly 71 lakh
graduates had registered for
employment, of which half
lakh were aris and science
graduates, two lakh were

MBA graduates and the re- ,

maining engineering gradu-
ates. “Education has to serve
two purpose, one, to teach
the youth about howto earn
his living either through em-
ployment or self-employ-
ment. Second, to teach how
to lead one’s life with what
one earns. The first purpose
décides the standard of life;
while the second, decides
s the quality of life”; /hepoint-
ed out.

Whatever the branch of
study may be, Balagurusamy
said, majority of the engi-
neering graduates prefer to
work for multi-national
software companies rather
than opting for core compa-
nies, due to good salary
package. This had finally
resulted in the contraction
of manufacturing units in

India, due to lack of skilled
hard core technical engi-
neers.

“Skill development should
be part and parcel of the
education process. Every
youth ought to practise at
least the basic skills of their
core branch of study”, he
said and stressed thaf skills:
should not be taught but

Re-quoting Makara
Gandhi’s phrase, he said
knowledge without charac-
ter, science without human-
ity and wealth without work,
were deadly sins. Only when
those sins were eradicated,
a corruption free world can
be easily created, he said.

“Positive thinking should
be developed among stu-
dents. They should be taught

 

to do right things for the
right purpose”, he insisted.

About a recent report, he
said only 20 percent of en-
gineering graduates and 10-
15 percent of arts and sci-
ence graduates alone were
identified as skilled gradu-
ates. As majority of the
graduates opted to work'for

“Psyco-meter and cogni-
tive skills are two important
skills that every youth
should develop. Psyco-me-

students learn in their edu-
cational institutions. But
cognitive skill is what every
student should develop”, he
