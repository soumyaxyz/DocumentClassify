TIRUCHI: Bharathidasan Uni-
versity is in the process of
creating digital libraries in
two of its constituent colleg-
es; at the newly started one in
Inamkulathur in Tiruchi dis-
trict and the existing college
in Perambalur district.

In due course, the universi-
ty intends to extend the facil-
ity that would pave way for
students and faculties to ac-
cess ils extensive e-resources
to the constituent colleges at
Nannilam, Vedaranyam and
Thiruthuraipoondi. The dig-
ital libraries are to be devel-
oped by uploading
institutional documents, lec-
ture notes, presentations,
question banks, project re-
ports, audio and video clip-
pings and newsletters. Web
link to the university library's
e-content enables access to
8,000 online journals and
10,000 e-books of text and
reference.

The initiative to start dig-
ital libraries was in keeping
with the emphasis of National
Policy on Education 1986 on
providing opportunities for
teachers’ professional and ca-
reer growth in the higher edu-
cation system, Vice
Chancellor K.Meena said on
Thursday after getting the
digital library in the UGC-
Academic ‘Staff College in
Khajamalai campus commis-
sioned by V.Muthuchezhian,
Vice Chancellor of Periyar
University, Salem.

The library, which now has
a collection of 1,772 books
covering various disciplines

search, will cater to training
and research requirements of
academic participants. Since
its start in 1987, the ASC has
conducted 238 academic pro-
grammes for nearly 9000 fac-
ulty, principals and
administrators of colleges
and universities. More books
and multimedia equipment
will be provided, Dr.Meena
said.

The UGC-BDU-ASC web-
site launched on the occasion
by Arjun Dev, Professor and
Member, Indian Council for
Historical Research, provides
details on its various pro-

 

grammes, online application
forms, its facilities and ASC
publications. A separate web-
site for ASC library links a
range of open access scholar-
ly resources and tutorials.
Dr.Muthuchezhian said
academic libraries have be-
come catalysts in education
and research, owing to the
new channels for transmit-
ting information, in conjunc-
tion with the curriculum. An
educational system that
makes education reachable to
all beyond geographical bar-
riers will pave way for emer-
gence of new sources of

‘information .

Internet, he
said, has brought dramatic
changes to millions of people
in terms of how they collect,
organise, disseminate, and

use information, he said, add- |

ing that library resources can
easily be made reachable to
many by digitising them and
uploading the same on Local
Area Network as web pages.

T.Ramaswamy, Registrar,
Bharathidasan _ University,
said the university has been
in the forefront in taking ICT-
based learning to constituent
colleges, as advocated by the
UGC.
