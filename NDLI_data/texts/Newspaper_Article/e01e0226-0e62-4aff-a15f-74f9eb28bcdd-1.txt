er information resources
available in the region.

Such a network weuld
bridge the gap between the
educational institutions
which possessed: rich re-
pository and moderate li-
brary facility, due to dwin-
dling budget. “This would
also create an awareness
amoiig researchers and stu-
dents to access aeademic
and research information,”
she added.

As majority of the eduea-
tional institutes are unaware
ofthe advantages of register-
ing with INFLIBMET, the
university m collaboration
with information agencies
like INFLIBNET and DEL-
NET (Developing Library
Network) is planning to con-
duct an awareness pro-
gramme on how to access
scholarly information and
resources,” Meena said.
