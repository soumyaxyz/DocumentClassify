MUMBAI: A galaxy of women
achievers, including former

global symposium “Women
Changing India” organised by

annual symposium in the series
and the first time here in India,

ers in their communities, in eco-
nomic development, in activist
movements, in corporate board
rooms, their influence is really
at the heart of everything hap-
pening here,” said Debora Spar,

 

president of Barnard College,
on a visit to Mumbai. Around

Six students, who are here
along with faculty, will also con-
duct a day-long workshop for
students of six different schools
at Cathedral and John Connon
School in Fort, including a finan-

cial literacy programme and
leadership exercises.

Barnard College was estab-
lished in 1889 as a college affili-
ated to Columbia University,
when the Ivy League institutions
did not admit women. Barnard
is legally separate from Columbia
but is referred to as an affiliated
college, While several originally
women-only colleges have
become co-educational, Barnard
is still for women only. The col-
lege has a total strength of 2,300
undergraduate students in vari-
ous liberal arts programmes, and
has about:12 Indian students com-
ing inevery year, a figure that has
jumped nearly two-fold compared
to five years ago, said officials.

Famous alumni from the col-
lege include writer Jhumpa
Lahiri, businesswoman Martha
Stewart and activist and writer
Fatima Bhutto.
