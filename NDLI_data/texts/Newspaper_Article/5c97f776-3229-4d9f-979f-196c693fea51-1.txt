A rapid detection kit,
which has been newly de
veloped by ICAR-Central
Institute of Fisheries Tech-
nology (CIFT) in Cochin,
Kerala for checking adul
terants in fresh fish could
prove to be an important
tool to detect fish preserva-
tives.

The kit is said to be aF
fordable and user-friendly
despite being developed

with advanced technol
ogy. Once made available
in the market for commer-
cial use, it will help Goans
expose the bad practices
of fish traders, who use
harmful chemicals like

ammonia or formalin for
preservation of fish.

“The kit contains a paper
strip and it has a chemical
solution, which is a user-
friendly technology. Just
one paper strip needs to be
taken and swabbed onto
a fish in different areas
at least three-four times.
When brought in contact
with fish, the strip will
change its colour if forma-
lin or any other chemical
is present,” said director of
CIFT Dr C N Ravishankar
while speaking to ‘The
Navhind Times’ over the
phone.

He said that the entire
process ofthe test will take

only two minutes, add-
ing that the kit will soon
be made available across
the country. “Any gov-
emment, private labora-
tory or common man can
afford this kit The pa-
per strips will be priced
around Rs 3 each and a
kit will have 50 strips,” he
said.

Dr Ravishankar said that
there is formalin present
naturally in a few species
of marine fish. However,
studies have not found
any chemical in freshwa-
ter fish. He said the natu-
ral presence of formalin is
mostly found in species of
fish like Bombay duck. He
said that the kit is devel-
oped in such a way that it
can only detect the added

formalin and not the nat-
ural formalin which is in-
herently present in some
species.

“We have done an ex-
tensive survey of fishing
and it is nowhere that the
naturally occurring for
malin will be more than
2 ppm (parts per million).
Our kit will detect the for-
malin present at 4 ppm
and above and if it is less
than that, then it is safe for
human consumption,” he
said. Dr Ravishankar said
that a chart is also provid-
ed with the kit which will
identify the nature of the
chemical used as preserv-
ative for the fish.

He said that there are
chances that formalin from
fish samples may evapo-
fate and it could be one of
the major reasons why the

Food and Drugs Admin-
istration (FDA) agency of
different states may have
failed to detect the deadly
chemical in fish.

He said that interna-
tional and national gov-
ermment agencies have
prohibited any form of
preservatives for fish and
issued strict guidelines
according to which fresh
fish or shellfish should be
preserved only by means
of ice.

Dr Ravishankar said
that the government has
outsourced the manu-
facturing of the rapid de-
tection kit to a particular
company for bulk produc-
tion and for the time be-
ing, one of the samples of
the kit has been provided
by the CIFT to FDA in Goa
free of cost.
