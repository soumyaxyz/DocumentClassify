Seaweed can make
your noodles more
nutritious, healthy

Scientists of ICAR-CIFT are planning to undertake a
study on the marine species available off AP coast

 

seaweed

Seaweeds are marine
species which thrive in the
rocky intertidal and sub-
tidal regions in low
sunlight environment

Seaweeds are low in
calorie but very rich in
protein and other
bioactive compounds

They are good sources of
pigments, chelated micro-
minerals, vitamin A, Bl,
B12, C, D and E, riboflavin,
niacin, pantothenic acid,
folic acid and other
minerals

Rich in dietary fibres,
seaweeds have benefits
like weight management,
improvement in
cardiovascular and
gastrointestinal health
and even cancer
prevention

AT a time when the use of seaweeds as nutrient supple-
ments is catching up as a trend, a recent study conducted
by the ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology
(ICAR-CIFT) appears to have opened a vista for the utili-
sation of marine algae as potential functional ingredients
in food processing industry.

The CIFT scientists and researchers who conducted a
study on a group of aquatic algae procured off Rameswar-
am coast in Tamil Nadu say that the seaweeds rich in
nutrients can be a part of the daily food

“Certain algae those thrive in the rocky intertidal and
sub-tidal regions at a certain depth in low sunlight envi-
ronment are low in calorie, but very rich in vitamin, pro-
tein and other bioactive compounds. Though seaweeds
are hardly used as food in India, they are very popular in
China, Japan and Korea,” says Jesmi Debbarma, a scien-
tist of CIFT, Vizag.

A group of ICAR-CIFT scientists who conducted a re-
search for two years have found that the seaweed extracts
can be used as nutrient supplements in soups, noodles
and other oriental cuisines.

During the research, they procured seaweeds like Sar-
gassum wightii (brown seaweed), Ulva lactuca (sea let-
tuce ) and Gracillaria edulis (red algae) and optimised the
extraction of dietary fibre before incorporating them to
fish sausage. The sausage fortified with up to3 percent of
dietary fibre from Gracillaria edulis and Sargassum
wightii , and 1 percent from Ulva lactuca, ensuring a bet-
ter consumer acceptability.

“A potential source of dietary fibre, seaweeds.can be
effectively used to fortify fish sausages. We also

noodles, adding puree prepared from Ulva lactuca and i

increased the crude fibre content of the noodles which
were well accepted by the consumers. Previous studies
also have indicated that these dietary fibres can be used
as potential functional ingredients in food processing,”
says Jesmi Debbarma.
