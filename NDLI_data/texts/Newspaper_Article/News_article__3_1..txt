Can't allow persecution of minorities, SC tells Orissa

EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE
NEW DELHI, JANUARY 5

IRECTING the
D Orissa Government
to refrain from tak-

ing a. unilateral decision while
considering the withdrawal
of security forces from the re-
gion, the Supreme Court on
Monday observed that it was
the duty of the state to pro-
tect the minorities.

“We are a secular country.
And (we) cannot allow per-
secution of minorities,” re-
marked one of the judges of
the three-member bench
headed by Chief Justice K G
Balakrishnan. Justice
Markandeya Katju re-
marked, “It is the duty of
the state Government to

protect the minority commu-
nity. You have done that only
after 50,000 people of the
minority community fled to
the jungles.”

State counsel K K Venu-
gopal, however, submitted
that all the earlier court or-
ders had been complied
with, to which Justice Katju,
without directly referring to
attacks on Christians in the
aftermath of the killing of
VHP leader Swami Lax-
manananda Saraswati, said,
“We will not accept the per-
secution of minority. If the
Government is unable to
protect them it should re-
sign. We have to protect the
minority. No minority com-
munity should feel insecure
in the country,” the judge

further observed.

The apex court in its earlier
hearings had directed para-
military forces to be sta-
tioned in the riot-hit areas till
December-end in view of the
perceived risk during Christ-
mas celebrations. After some
objections were raised on the
withdrawal of forces, the
Court restrained the state
Government from taking any
unilateral decision on their
withdrawal and asked it to
coordinate the matter with
the Centre.

Counsel Colin Gonsalves
representing the Archbishop,
of Cuttack ~—- Raphael
Cheenath submitted that
there had been a “deceptive”
calm in the area after the de-
ployment of the Central

forces and also criticised
the meagre compensation
amount for repair of the
damaged churches. The ad-
vocate argued that the State
was providing only Rs 50,000
for the places of worship
which were completely dam-
aged in the fire, while the ac-
tually estimate for repair was
Rs 5 to 6 lakh. Moreover, in
certain cases no compensa-
tion was being considered.
The state counsel replied
that the compensation was
being kept on hold for certain
cases of disputed land where
there were issues relating to
encroachment of land.
