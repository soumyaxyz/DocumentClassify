TIRUCHI: The approach to de-
velop competencies for em-
ployability advocated by the
Tamil Nadu Skill Develop-
ment Mission , (TNSDM)
would bes’ integrated into
school and higher education
curricula during the 12" five
year plan period, E. Balaguru-
samy, Member, | Education),
State Planning Commission,
said on Wednesday.
Employability was a major
issue as only 20 per cent of
engineering graduates and 15
per cent of arts and science
graduates were ready for jobs.
A majority among the 71 lakh
unemployed people regis-
tered with the ‘employment
exchanges in the state were
sraduates. There was some-
thing seriously, wrong with
the education system, Mr.Ba-
lagurusamy said, inaugurat-
ing a UGC training workshop
on employability skills orga-
nised by Department of Life-
ong Learning, Bharathidasan
University, in, association
with the university’s constit-

 

Skills cannot be taught; it
has to be developed by the
learners themselves. Charac-

ter building was important.*

The prevalent scenario
wherein engineering  stu-
dents were refusing to devel-
op core skills due to a desire
to become software program-
mers explains the dip in the
growth of manufacturing sec-
tor. Skills could be well devel-
oped only during the course
of education in schools and
colleges, he said and advocat-
ed life-long learning to coun-
ter knowledge obsolescence.

Character building

The younger generation
should develop courage by
building traits like character,
competency and conviction,
said Dr. Balagurusamy, who
also released a_ training
manual on employability
skills brought out by the De-
partinent of Life Long Learn-
ing on the occasion.

plovable skills pertaining to

longing to five colleges, in-
cluding three constituent
units of the university. The
university's Centre for Youth
Development and Studies

cio-economically poor stu-
dents through training
programmes. The university
plans to organise an interface
between industry representa-
tives and placement officers
of affiliated colleges on Janu-
ary 4, Dr. Meena said.

Acquisition of skills while
studying in schools and col-
leges will stand job-seekers in
good stead after education,
