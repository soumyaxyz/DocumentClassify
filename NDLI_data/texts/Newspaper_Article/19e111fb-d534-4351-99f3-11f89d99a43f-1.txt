TIRUCHI: An NCC camp train-
ing centre featuring a slither-
ing platform along with other
facilities will soon come up
on the sprawling premises of
the Bharathidasan Universi-
ty’s main campus for conduct
of camps and to impart vari-
ous types of training to ca-
dets.

its land to establish the train-
ing centre with financial as-
sistance of over Rs. 9 lakh
from the State government,
the University has obviated
the need for the NCC Group
Headquarters here to ap-
proach educational institu-
tions requesting _ their
facilities for conduct of
camps and training pro-
grammes.

Other facilities constitute
firing range, obstacle course,
platforms to erect tents and
other basic paraphernalia in-
cluding a stage and toilets.
The slithering platform will
be the first of its kind in an
NCC camp training centre in
Tamil Nadu, the Group Com-
mander, NCC Group Head-
quarters, Tiruchi, Colonel S.
Ved Nayagam, said. The cen-

While Rs. 4 lakhs would be
utilised for the slithering
platform, Rs. 3.8 lakh would
be spent for the firing range,
and Rs. 1.55 lakhs for creating
the obstacle course. The
slithering platform will be a
concrete structure with a
staircase for cadets to go up
to get into a replica of a hel-
