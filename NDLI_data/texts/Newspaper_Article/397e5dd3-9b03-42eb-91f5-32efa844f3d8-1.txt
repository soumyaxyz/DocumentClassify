Look beyond engineering,

TIRUCHI: It was essential for
students to look beyond engi-
neering and medicine to ex-
plore opportunities in
different disciplines in higher
education, observed speakers
at a session on Career Plan-
ning organised by the Con-
federation of Indian Industry
here on Friday.

Identify your aptitude
early and shun herd mental-
ity, E.Balagurusamy, Member
(Education), State Planning
Commission, told the large
contingent of Plus Two stu-
dents from various schools in
the city. “The country needs
to generate more blue-col-
lared rather than white-col-
lared jobs. The objective of
education should be to pro-
duce good human beings
rather than coacha student to
score centum. There was no
point in producing engineers
who cannot apply their
knowledge in day-to-day
life,” he observed.

The country, as an eco-
nomic superpower, was full of
opportunities. It requires a
large number _ technically
skilled manpower for sustain-
able development.

The manufacturing sectors

, should be the pivot of devel-

opment. In the next five
years, the country would re-

quire about 10 lakh teachers
and it was also facing a huge
shortage of scientists. No
country could progress with-
out scientists.

Putting forward a 10-point
mantra for holistic develop-
ment for the students, Mr.Ba-
lagurusamy urged the
students to develop compe-
tence, courage and character
to succeed in their chosen
discipline. G.Balakrishnan,

a,

former vice principal, St.Jo-
seph’s College, called upon
the students to draw up their
higher education plans on a
five-year time frame.

Students should not fall for
the popular perception that
engineering and medicine
were the only professional
opportunities.

“Think differently to ex-
plore opportunities in diverse
disciplines, including human-

a\wyery A\

ities with value addition tc
their degrees.

Students should equip
themselves with soft skills
and exhibit individuality to
excel in their chosen field of
study,” he said.
