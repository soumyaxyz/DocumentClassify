* with full time Magistrate and
two social workers one of
whom at least a woman who
have an experience in work-
ing with the children.

JB Pradhan, the Addi-
tional Advocate General
representing the State Goy-
ernment has submitted that
the state lacks sufficient cas-
es of Juvenile in compari-
son to other states of India
and that working in the four
districts with the full time
Magistrate would not be
justified. “As and when the
work load would increase
the appointment of full time
Magistrate with the regular
working days will be con-
sidered,” he said,

tioner while speaking to

all the Human Rights law-
yers across the country. She
added’ that the judgment
has been referring as a pre-
cedent in the other states.
“If all the provisions
of Justice Juvenile Act are
implemented in the State
thoroughly, Sikkim will be
a frontal runner in this mat-
. ter,” Dr. Bhutia said.
