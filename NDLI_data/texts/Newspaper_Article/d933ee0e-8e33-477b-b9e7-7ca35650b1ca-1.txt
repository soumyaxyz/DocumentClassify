HC Bench quashes UGC’s “arbitrary” order

Readers must be promoted from date of completion of eights years of service

Mohamed Imranullah S.

 

MADURAI: Readers who had
completed eight years of ser-
vice and found eligible for
promotion to the post of Pro-
fessor under the Career Ad-
vancement Scheme (CAS)
must be promoted from the
date when they completed
eight years of service and not
from the date when the uni-
versity, in which they were
working, conducted the inter-
view, the Madras High Court
- Bench here ruled.

Justice P.  Jyothimani
passed the ruling while allow-
ing writ petitions filed by four
Readers. of Bharathidasan

University in Tiruchi to set
aside an order passed by the
University Grants Commis-
sion (UGC) in December
2005 rejecting their plea to
grant them promotion from
2003 when they completed
eights years of service and not
from 2005 when the inter-
view was held.

‘The judge pointed out that
it was the UGC which had
framed the CAS in order to
create promotion opportuni-
ties for the Readers.

As per the scheme, a Read-
er who had completed eight
years of service would be eli-
gible to be given notional pro-
motion with monetary and

other benefits. However, the
individual must continue to
perform his duties as a Read-
er even after being promoted.
In the present case, the
Bharathidasan —_ University
had conducted an interview
in 2003 and sent a proposal to
the UGC to promote the four
petitioners A. Alice and Aru
Marudhadurai of the Depart-
ment of Tamil, M. Krishnan
of the Department of Eco-
Biotechnology and M.V. Rao
of the Department of Plant
Science as Professors from
the date when they had com-
pleted eight years of service.
However, when the pro-
posal was sent only Dr. Ma-

rudhadurai alone had
completed eight years of ser-
vice. The three others were a
few months short of the stip-
ulated time.

The university thought
that the UGC would take time
to grant approval and by then
the three Readers would com-
plete the requisite service.
But the UGC rejected the en-
tire proposal for want of com-
pletion of service.

Thereafter, the university
conducted another interview
for the petitioners in 2005
and the UGC granted approv-
al for their promotion from
the date when the second in-
terview was conducted and

hence the present writ pet-
itions. The petitioners’ coun-
sel K. Govindarajan
contended that his clients
could not be punished for the
mistake, if any, committed by
the university.

Accepting his submissions,
the judge said: “In my consid-
ered opinion when there was
no fault on the part of the
petitioners and when it is not

. the case of suppression of any
material fact so as to make
them ineligible for the equi-
table remedy which is being
given in the CAS by the UGC,
I have no hesitation to hold
that the act of the UGC is to-
tally arbitrary.”
