“V-Cs must declare their

assets in university websites”

Special Correspondent

 

MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu
Federation of Universities
Faculty Associations (TAN-
FUFA) has called for State-
wide protests on March 10 “to
focus attention on alleged
corruption in appointment of
Vice-Chancellors for univer-
sities in the State.”

Tt also demanded that
the Vice-Chancellors must
declare their assets and put
the details in the w'

respective

tore, during and alter
tenure.

S. Krishnaswamy, Conve-
nor, TANFUFA, in a press
statement here on Tuesday
said that the association had
brought to the Governor's at-
tention on February 15 about
the “open secret of corrup-
tion that prevails with respect
to appointments in universi-
ties starting from recruiting
faculty members to nomina-
tion of members to Senate/
Syndicate to appointing Vice-
Chancellors. The Day of Pro-

education.”
“The life of a University lies
in its people - students, staff,

faculty, officers and Vice-
Chancellor. The quality, in-
tegrity and commitment of
these people make or mar the
University. If corrective steps
were not taken, it is bound to
degenerate beyond redemp-
tion,” Dr. Krishnaswamy ob-
served.

The TANFUFA press re-
lease had said that merit has
been thrown to wind in sever-
al VC appointments and
mostly persons having little

esearch exposure and ad-
trative experience have
been appointed whereas can-
didates who won laurels such
as Bhatnagar awards were
sidelined.

“Time and again there are
reports in the air that money
plays a crucial role in VC ap-
pointments. For an eminent
academician like Prof. M.
Anandakrishnan to call the
university system scandalous
because of the commerciali-
sation of the appointment of
Vice-Chancellors is but a sad
reflection of the state of af-
fairs,” Dr.Krishnaswamy

   

  

gulations clear-
hat | persons of the
highest level of competence,
integrity, morals and institu-

tional commitment are to be
appointed as Vice-Chancel-
lors. The Vice-Chancellor to
be appointed should be a dis-
tinguished academic, with a
minimum of 10 years experi-
ence as Professor in a uni-
versity system or 10 years
experience in an equivalent
position in areputed research
and / or academic adminis-
trative organisation”.

The TANFUFA convenor
has expressed concern that
unfortunately Vice-Chancel-
lors have come under the
scanner of DVAC and CBI of-
ten but most of them are not
really pursued to the logical
end.

“Now, a time has come
when TANFUFA cannot re-
frain from bringing this to the
public and to take all reme-
dial steps to curb such unde-
sirable factors impacting
higher education to ensure
cleansing the system and
keeping it fit to meet the ex-
pectations of all the stake-
holders,” he said. TANFUFA
demands that all Vice-Chan-
cellors declare their assets
and curriculum vitae in the
respective University web-
sites before, during and after
their term of office.
