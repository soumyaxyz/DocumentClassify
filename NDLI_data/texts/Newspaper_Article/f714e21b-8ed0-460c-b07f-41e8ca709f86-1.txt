Organic Scientist Sounds
Alarm Against Pesticide Use

Express News Service

Tiruchy: Noted organic
scientist Nammazhvar on
Thursday said awareness on
the harmful effects of pesti-

—cides should be created
among farmers.

Speaking at the valedic-
tion of the refresher course
in Life Sciences and Math-
ematics, held at the UGC
Staff College, Bharathidasan
University, Khajamalai cam-
pus here on Thursday, he
detailed the consequences
of using hazardous pesti-
cides like endosulfan.

He complained that the
people are using hazardous
chemicals though they know
full well the after effects.

He explained how the en-
tire food cycle is getting af-
fected because of pesticides.

Though these hazardous
chemicals or pesticides are
used only on plants, it af-
fects the entire food cycle.
When herbivores feed on
plants, the poison from the
plants affects them, which
in turn affect the carnivores
and the omnivores. Thus the
entire food cycle gets af-
fected. Even the milk that a
mother feeds her baby is
poisoned, as she consumes
fruits and vegetables grown
with the use of pesticides, he
poined out.

years to yield fruits and veg-
etables rich in vitamins and
minerals but a human being
turns it into a poisonous
substance by just applying
hazardous chemicals, he
said. Any plant should pro-
tect the soil, cattle and hu-
man beings, he added.

AUthirapathy, Syndicate
Member, Bharathidasan
University, in his presiden-
tial address said, it is the
responsibility of the teach-
ers to train the youths who
constitute more than 60 per
cent of the population.

The refresher course in
Mathematics trained the
teachers in Algebra, Geom-
etry and calculus. Hands-on
training was also provided
with the help of MatLab, he

 

said.

While a refresher course *
in Life Sciences trained the
teachers in Global Warm- -
ing, Nano-Technology and +
Nano-Toxicology, hands-on
training enabled the users
to learn anatomy without -
dissecting an animal.

A total of 38 teachers,
including 17 teachers in Life
Sciences and 21 teachers in
Mathematics, participated’
in the refresher course. Cer-
tificates were distributed to
participants.
