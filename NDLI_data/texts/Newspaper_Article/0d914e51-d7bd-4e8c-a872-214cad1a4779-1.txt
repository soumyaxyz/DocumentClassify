After U.R. Ananthamurthy died last week, many of the public expressions of condolence were by people who had met him on one
or two occasions but remembered him vividly. URA, as Ananthamurthy was known, brought the fullest attention, warmth and care to
all his interactions. There was a soulfulness to his presence. It was impossible not to be touched by him.

Born in Thirthahalli, in Karnataka’s Shimoga district, in 1932, URA spent his boyhood in an agrahara (the Brahmin quarter of the
village). His encounter with the thought of politician Ram Manohar Lohia and his involvement in the farmers’ satyagraha in
Kagodu, Shimoga district, in 1951, through socialist leader Shantaveri Gopala Gowda, proved to be a lasting influence (URA’s
third novel, Avasthe—The Predicament, 1978—is based on the life of the latter). The challenges of thinking about caste equality, the
paramount importance of Indian languages for creativity and authentic knowledge, and the value of democratic decentralization
remained his lifelong passions.

URA failed in science in his intermediate exams, dashing his father’s hopes of his son becoming a mathematician. After months of
reading the world classics (Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, P.B. Shelley), he decided to pursue English literature at the University of
Mysore. Prof. C.D. Narasimhaiah, the distinguished literary scholar credited with the founding discussions on the idea of
Commonwealth literature, was among his teachers.
