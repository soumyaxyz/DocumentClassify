Coimbatore: With the
change of guard in Tamil
Nadu, afew vice-chancellors
and academicians holding
key positions, who had close-
ly identified themselves with
the erstwhile DMK rulers,
may find the going tough.

Ever since the AADMK
secured a landslide victory
on Friday, academic circles
have been abuzz with talk of
the difficulties certain vice-
chancellors are likely to en-
counter while discharging
their duties due to their po-
litical allegiance.

For instance, University of
Madras Vice-Chancellor G
Thiruvasagam has publicly
projected himself as a pro-
tege of former Chief Minister
M Karunanidhi and his elder
son and Union minister M K
Alagiri. He had even partici-
pated in the latter’s birthday
celebrations in Madurai.

Soon after assuming of-
fice, he launched a Master of
Arts programme in Kalaig-
nar Thought. Earlier, when
he was heading the affairs of
the Bharathiar University in

Coimbatore, he had commis-
sioned the translation of
Karunanidhi’s literary works
into Chinese and English.

Similarly, Tamil Nadu
Open University Vice-Chan-
cellor Kalyani Anbuchelvan,
the daughter-in-law of for-
mer finance minister K An-
bazhagan, has hailed DMK
leaders in public forums.

Going by the book, the
government cannot remove
them until the end of their
tenure, but the apprehension
is that it can pose stumbling
blocks in different ways.

Likewise, Prof A Ra-
masamy, vice-chairman of
the Tamil Nadu State Coun-
cil for Higher Education
(TANSCHE), has been asso-
ciated with the DMK since
his student days. In a book
he authored last year on the
DMK’s history, he was bit-
terly critical of AIADMK
chief J J Jayalalithaa.

But, sources close to Ra-
masamy pointed out that in
2001, when Jayalalithaa re-
turned to power, he was al-
lowed to complete his term
as Vice-Chancellor of the
Alagappa University smooth-

ly, since he did not bring in |

politics into the university
administration. He has a
year before his tenure ends.

TANSCHE member-secre- |
tary Baskaran, incidentally,
happens to be former higher ~

education minister K Pon-
mudy’s PhD guide. But, he
has largely remained a non-

controversial person without _

publicly taking positions.
While it is nothing new for
academicians to associate

themselves ideologically or ©

politically with either of the

two principal Dravidian par-
ties in the State, usually those |
in top positions avoid mak-

ing their allegiance public
and restrict themselves to
extending backroom support
or giving policy inputs to the
government.

Academics pointed out
that in the last five years, the
appointment of V-Cs in
many universities was based
on either their proximity to
former CM Karunanidhi’s
family members or their ca-
pacity to influence certain
middlemen in Raj Bhavan.
An IAS official and a middle-
man in the Secretariat, who

were close to K Ponmudy, |

too played a key role in uni-
versity affairs.

This extra-constitutional |

group allegedly decided by
rotation who should be the
V-C, and also got persons

with no competence nomi- |
nated to the syndicates, sen- —

ates and academic councils
of several universities for
extraneous consideration.
