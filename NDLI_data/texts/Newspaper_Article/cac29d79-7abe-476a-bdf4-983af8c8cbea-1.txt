TIRUCHI: Bhavathidasan Uni-
versity has expressed sur-
prise over thie “quite low”
score awarded by the Nation-
al Assessment and Accredita-
tion Council (NAAC) to its
Academic taff College
(ASC).

According to S.Aruchamy,
Registrar In-Charge, the
score was not matching with
the report submitted by the
NAAC Peer Team. The review
report of the ASC, he pointed
out, looked “very positive”
with “several compliments”
and “good remarks” about the
performance of ASC.

“We are trying to get in
touch with the NAAC, Banga-
dore, to check about the meth-
odology of scoring and. any
possible erroxs, and ways to
rectify it,” Mr Arachamy said
ina press release.

The university was seeking
to clarify if the report per-
tained to the performance of
the university during 2005-
2010, the release said, adding
that for the last two years
since July 2010 when the pre-
sent Vice-Chancellor, K.Mee-
na, assumed office, several
initiatives were undertaken.

The initiatives include up-
gradation of computer facil-
ity to the participants; provi-
sion of NLIST facility and
access to e-resources for par-
ticipants thereby creating
1CT-enabled learning énvi-
ronment; access to university
library including . INFLIP
NET; creation of website for
ASC; preparation of learning
materials; creation of addi-
tional basic amenities includ-
ing additional toilets and
office for resource persons;
and renovation of air-condi-
tioned seminar hall.

“The university is very
hopeful that the issue of ap-
parent mismatch between
the (Peer Team) report and
the (NAAC) score shown if
the website will be clarified
very soon,” the release said.

The latest report on
NAAC’s review of Academic
Staff Colleges published in its
website: , placed the ASC of
Bharathidasan University in
63" spot as one among seven
in ‘non-performer’ list. The
ASC, the report said, had
scored just 35 out of 100.

The other three universi-
ties: Bharathiyar, Madurai
Kamaraj and Madras univer-
sities, were placed much bet-
ter, though as
‘under-performers’, with
scores of 55, 47 and 46 re-

spectively.

Universities with scores
below 40 were categorised as
non-performers, and those

with scores between 40 and
60 as under-performers,

Ranking of the ASCs ia w
versities is based on the visits
