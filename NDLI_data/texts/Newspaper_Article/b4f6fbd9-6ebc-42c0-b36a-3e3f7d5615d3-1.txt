Violation Claims in AU

Express News Service

Tiruchy: A section of em-
ployees have come out with
allegations of violations in
the appointment of non-
teaching faculty at the Anna
University of Technology-
Tiruchy AUTT and demand-
ed a DVAC probe.

Though the advertise-
ments issued by the Anna
University in the newspa-
pers, dated June 14,2010
and December 18,2010,
mentioned recruitment of
faculty as its subject. But,
the university also recruited
non-teaching faculty.

The advertisement issued
on June 14, clearly explained
the roster system and num-
ber of posts vacant in each
department under the teach-
ing category, while the sec-
ond advertisement that was
published on December 18,
was said to be ambiguous.

Though a major part of
the advertisement was for

_ seeking teaching faculty, the

university has included the
vacancies in non-teaching
faculty posts also. Besides,
the university has also failed
to clarify about the roster
system and the eligibility
criteria

As the government has
sanctioned an estate officer
under the non-teaching cat-
egory, the vice-chancellor
has offered appointment to
P Rajesh Prasanna, as for
the post under non-teaching
faculty category. Actually,
Govindaswamy, former
deputy secretary, Higher
Education, was nominated
as the government nominee
for non-teaching posts by
the government.

But the minutes available
denote MS Palaniswami,
former vice-chancellor,
Tamil Nadu Open Univer-
sity as the government nom-
inee. This sounded fishy, as
his signature was missing in
the minutes book, when the

  

 

Some employees of Anna University of Technology, Tiruchy, say non-faculty jobs were given
under the faculty recruitment programme

signature of other candi-
dates who attended the in-
terview were found.

The candidate, P Rajesh
Prasanna, was appointed as
a professor-cum-estate of-
ficer, by the vice-chancellor
of Anna Varsity, P Devadas
Manoharan. Rajesh Pras-

anna was not an eligible
candidate, as his qualifica-
tions and experience dif-
fered from the set post, the
employees allege.

The vice-chancellor has
also offered appointment to
a candidate by creating a
new nomenclature.

As per the government
order dated, May 5,2010, a
pass in NET or SLET or an
equivalent examination
shall be compulsory at the
entry level for getting ap-
pointed as the assistant di-
rector of physical education
or as the college director of

Rec

physical education, subject
to exemption, if the candi-
date hold a PhD degree.

Violating the government
order, Devadas has appoint-
ed C Sathiyanarayanamoor-
thi, as physical trainee with
apayscale of 715,000, which
was equivalent to that of a
teaching faculty, though
there was no such post or
nomenclature available and
the candidate also lacked a
NET/SLET or a PhD quali-
fication.

The varsity published no
advertisement to inform the
public about recruitment of
a physical director, though
the minutes state that an
interview was conducted for
the vacancies under the
non-teaching category. The
signature of the government
appointed nominee was
missing in the minutes,
when the signature of others
were present.

Though the advertise-
ments that were published

part ee Th DO.
rultment

in June and December,
2010, were.for want of fac-
ulty in the Ariyalur campus,
the candidate was placed in
the varsityâ€™s Tiruchy cam-
pus. The employees, both
teaching and non-teaching
staff complain that all the
norms related to appointing
a faculty in the physical
education department were
over ruled, just because the
vice-chancellor wanted to
appoint Sathiyanarayana-
moorthi.

The necessary qualifica-
tions, NET/SLET/PhD was
not mentioned in the adver-
tisement, though it was a
must for a candidate, as per
the existing norms. He was
not placed in Ariyalur
though he was recruited for
the Ariyalur campus. No ad-
vertisement was published
to select candidates under
the non-teaching faculty
category. The employees
also demanded a DVAC en-
quiry into their allegations.
