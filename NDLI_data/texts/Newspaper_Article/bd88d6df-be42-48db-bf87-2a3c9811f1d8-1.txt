The University’s ad hoc
syndicate committee met on
‘Thursday and recommended

the names ofafthe members °

will consider several names
and recommend a list of
three to the Governor-Chan-

The syndicate committee
met after the government re-
jected its earlier recommen-

Mannar Jawahar, whose
term as Vice-Chanéellor got
over on Tuesday, and M. Se-
kar, who is the Dean, College

Recalling the earlier meet-
ing of the ad hoc committee,
a member said Mr. Jawahar,
who was the vice-chancellor
at the time of the meeting,
came and proposed his own
name for the three-member
committee.

As he was the chairman of

oversee Anna University

it was recommended by ad-hoc syndicate committee

the committee, none of the
members were able to’ op-
pose it.

When one of the members
wanted to know why Prof
Kaliraj, Dean, Alagappa Col-
lege of Technology, and the
senior most professor in the
university, was not part of
the committee, Mr. Jawahar
had told them that the senior
most professor rule would
apply only after the merger
of five technical universities
with the parent Anna Uni-
versity and till then, the (ad
hoc) syndicate committee
would make its own deci-
sion.

However, with the govern-
ment rejecting the recom-
mendation, the ad hoc
committee met again and
recommended the names of
Prof Kaliraj and Prof Sekar.

The government approved
the names on Thursday eve-
