writer in the record books

TIMES NEWS NETWORK

Gurgaon: Joygopal Podder, 51,
has made it to the Limca Book
of World Records for publish-
ing five novels within a period
of nine months — largest num-
ber of crime fiction books
written by an Indian author in
such a short duration.

Podder has written six
books within a span of the past
one year. His sixth and first
non-fiction book, “Truth Is
Stranger Than Fiction”, could
not be included in the record
as it was published in July,
soon after the entries for the
competition were closed on
June 30, 2011.

He is already waiting for
the publication of his seventh
book — Superstar — which will
hit the stands in November.
He is also working on his
eighth and ninth books. They
are all novels set in the Indi-
an film industry.

ActionAid, an NGO — decid-

ed to follow his childhood
dream of becoming a novelist
only last year. His first book —
Deceivers — was published in
September last year.

Before joining the NGO,
Podder had worked as a mar-
keting professional for 17 years.
“T write almost everyday. Writ-
ing gives me pleasure which

appreciate the effort,” he said.

He now wants to break two
more world records by be-
coming the fastest published
author, and create a Guinness
World Record of publishing
maximum number of books
in a year. Currently, the record
is in the name of a Japanese
author who wrote 20 books
in a year.
