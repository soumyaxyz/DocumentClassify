TIRUCHI: Complaining of se-
vere hardships caused by
acute shortage of electricity
and water supply, hundreds
of inmates of girls hostels of
Bharathidasan _—_ University.
staged a demonstration at the
entrance of the main campus
in the morning hours on
Wednesday.

The students were sore
that the university adminis-
tration that had given assur-
ances to look into the issue in
right earnest after the visit by
a NAAC peer team for re-ac-
creditation was now resort-
ing to vindictive approach.

“After all the sufferings we
endured for the entire previ-
ous night without electricity
and water, we are being
threatened by our respective
heads of departments to fall
in line or face consequences,”
students complained. Fol-
lowing prolonged conciliato-
ry talk by the Registrar
(in-charge) Aruchamy, the
students went back to their
classes in the afternoon.

According to the students,
the university has been drag-
ging its feet on ensuring daily
water supply in adequate
measure. The problem was
more due to mismanagement
accentuated by overcrowding

in the hostels than non-avail-
ability of water, they say.

The hostels are bursting at
seams since more than five
students are being accommo-
dated per room originally de-
signed for two students. Since
the water tank holding capac-
ity also corresponded to the
designed strength, the quan-
tum was not sufficient for the
much higher number of stu-
dents. As a consequence,
most of the students face the
predicament of attending
classes without their morning
bath, or even ablution, on
most days. The situation per-
sists despite the university
raising the hotel fee at period-

‘substantial money for the

ic intervals and earmarking

purpose of hostel mainte-
nance.

According to university
professors, who admit that
the hostel situation negativ-
ely impacts the classroom sit-
uation, the issue needs to be
handled reasonably. They see
a permanent solution to the
problem by providing back-
up generator sets to each hos-
tel to facilitate academic ac-
tivities during night hours,
and filling the water tank at
different times of the day, to
ensure that no student is de-
prived of water for basic
needs.
