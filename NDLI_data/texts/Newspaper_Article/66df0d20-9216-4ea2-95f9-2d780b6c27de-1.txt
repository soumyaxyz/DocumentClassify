SILVER JUBILEE OF
RAMAN EFFECT.

TRIBUTES FROM WORLD'S
LEADING SCIENTISTS

March 16, this year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the first formal announcement by Sir C. V. Raman of his dis-
‘covery of the Raman Effect, « fundamental and far-reaching
contribution to knowledge, which has since found wide appli-
cations in beth science and technology.

Leading scientists and thinkers in India and abroad have
sent special messages and articles te this Silver Jubilee Supple-
ment paying tribute te the brilliant achievements of the sclen-
tist in the fields of optics, X-rays, and crystal physics as well as
te the versatile and lovable qualities of Raman, the man.
