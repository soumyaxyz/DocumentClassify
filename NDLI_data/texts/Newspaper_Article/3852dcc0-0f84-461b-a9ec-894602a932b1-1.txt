through improved exercises

was the focus of the meeting |

around 110 Red ribbon clubs
in central Tamil Nadu at Bha-

eight districts under the ju-
risdiction of the university
participated in the ‘celebrat-
ing life’ training programme
organised by Red ribbon club

making efficient use of pro-
grammes such as arranging
interaction between students
and positive persons, and mo-
tivating voluntary blood
donation.

In the final session when
the floor was open for discus-
sion of challenges in imple-
menting the programme,
officers came up with sug-
gestions, including introduc-
ing blood grouping prior to
motivating blood donation
and setitog up first aid boxes
