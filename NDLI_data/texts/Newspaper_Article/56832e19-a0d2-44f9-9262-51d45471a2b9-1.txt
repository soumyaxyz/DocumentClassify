anti-diabetic and anti-micro-
bial properties. Focussing on
natural drug development for
curing diabetes mellitus, can-
cer and urinary tract infec-
tions, the team had isolated
and identified a total of 12
pure compounds from seven
plants, and had determined
their therapeutic efficacy on
animals without toxic effect.
The BIF centre had two data-
bases on medicinal plants and
the active principles for anti-
diabetic, antitmicrobial, anti
cancer and anti-oxidant ac-
tivities (hittp://

Focussing its research on
Phytotherapeutics, the cen-
tre has been working to devel-
op personnel and widen its
research on drug develop-
ment since its inception. The
BIF centre is now working for
the construction of metabolic
pathways for the natural ,
compounds by Systems Bio-
logical Approach. The centre
intends to develop software
for the drug metabolic path-
ways, principal Rev. Sr. Sar-
