CPI-M
elected
Prahash
Karat asGS
for 3rd term

 

al
NEW DELHI: Commu-
nist Party of India’s Marxist
leader Prakash Karat was
today re-elected as Commu-
nist Party of India’s (Marx-
ist) (CPI-M) General Secre-
tary for a third term.

Karat was elected as Gen-
eral Secretary in 2005 at the
New Delhi congress and
again at Coimbatore for the
second term. CPI (M) lead-
ership has recently fixed the
tenure of its secretaries at all
levels to three terms.

The significant amend-
ment restricting the tenure
was unanimously approved
by delegates at the 20th par-
ty congress in Kozhikode,
which concluded recently.
The congress, however, did
not consider a proposal to
fix the age limit for lead-
ers holding positions in the
party or governments.

The constitutional amend-
ment has a provision for a
secretary to continue for a
ourth term if three-fourths
of the members of respec-
tive party conferences (the
arty congress in the case of
general secretary) vote in his
or her favour.

The period between two
party conferences that con-
stitute a term is three years
unless the meets are delayed
due to various reasons.

SP Plans to propose Dr Abdul

Kalam as Presidential candidate Recognition Award
WN ‘Titanic’ film fame Paul Peabody (US),

LUCKNOW: The nuling
Samajwadi Party has started
considering the names to
be proposed for the coming
Presidential elections in the
country to be held in next
couple of month’s time.

The party could propose
the name of former Presi-
dent APJ Abdul Kalam for
the post of President of In-
dia provided all political
parties give unanimous ap-
proval to his name.

In a high level meeting,
held here recently, senior
party leaders discussed pos-
sible names of luminaries
whom Samajwadi Party
could support for the post of
President.

“There was a unanimous
view that former President
Dr Kalam should be given

another term,” a senior SP
leader said here.

The leaders, however,
vouch that they have yet to
get consent of Dr Kalam.
“Only hindrance seems to
be his age,” he said and add-
ed party would discuss this
name with Congress leader-
ship at an appropriate time.

Dr Kalam who was Presi-
dent of India between 2002-
2007 had refused to contest

 

for second term because

Congress refused to sup-
port his candidature. Even
than, Samajwadi Party and
CPI (M) has floated Dr Ka-
lam’s name. Then Bahujan
Samaj Party had supported
Congress candidate Prati-
bha Patil, who ultimately
was elected the first woman
President of India.

Election for the Presi-
dent’s post would be held

in June. Congress needs the
support of Samajwadi Party
to get a free passage to its
candidate.

SP with 33 MPs and 224
legislators under its belt is
really a force which Con-
gress could not ignore in
Presidential election

. The SP knows it and there-
fore, wants that candidate of
its choice should be elected
as the President.

“Samajwadi Party wants
to support a Muslim face in
Presidential election. Mu-
layam Singh Yadav wants
that Congress should also
accept Dr Kalam’s candida-
ture,” the source said.

So far Congress has kept
its cards close to its chest
and has not revealed names
of its choice for the election.

dence in Gurgaon.” Yuvraj is

nings against cancer. We are

Yuvraj’s father, Yograj

nels that his son was fine and

the cricket field soon.” Yuvi

ficult to cope up with. He’s
very strong... He’s come
back hail and hearty and
that is a beautiful moment
for me,” he said.

Kumble had flown to the
US to meet the star cricketer
when he was undergoing
chemotherapy.

stan People’s Party Chief

ing in poverty.

erty must spend so much on
weapons”.

views on nuclear weapons,
saying the atomic arsenal

equate to “destroy each
other multiple times over’.

instead invest in education,

healthcare and business so
that they could trade, “teach
each other” and “heal each
other’, he wrote. Earlierin

ing: “(As-salam-o-alaikum

tle bit of Pakistan in every

tween President Zardari and
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh over lunch, Bilawal
tweeted that his father and
he had enjoyed the lunch
“with Rahul Gandhi and PM

 

Singh. Lovely meal. Much
‘0 learn from each other”.

After a visit to the fa-
mous Sufi shrine of Khwaja
Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer,
Bilawal wrote that he had
offered a “special prayer
or our brave soldiers who
ost their lives in the Sia-
chen avalanche tragedy”. At
east 135 people, including
124 Pakistani soldiers, were
buried under snow after an
avalanche hit a battalion
headquarters in the Siachen
sector on Saturday.

Rescue teams have found
no signs of survivors so far.
Bilawal’s sister Aseefa too
ook to Twitter to clarify that
media reports about her ac-
companying her father to
ndia were wrong.
