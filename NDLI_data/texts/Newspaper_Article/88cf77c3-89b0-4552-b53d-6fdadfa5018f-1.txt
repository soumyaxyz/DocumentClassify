ormer’

It is the only institution in TN to earn the
‘non-performer’ tag for the period 2005-2010

Tiruchy: ‘The Academic
Staff College ASC) of Bhara-
thidasan University has be-
‘come the only institution in
Tamil Nadu io earn the dis-
tinction of a ‘sion-performer’
as per the National Assess-
_ Ment and Accreditation

' Council (NAAC) report, for.

the period 2005-2010.
The worrisome factor is
that only three colleges, two

  

in the educationally back-
ward States of Chaitisgarh
and Bihar, rank below Bhara-
thidasan University, situated
right in the heart of Tamil
Nadu, known as an educa-
tional hub in the State. This
is the only.non-performer
ASC in Tamil Nadu.

The ASC of Bharathidasan
University has notched the
63rd rank out of 66 colleges
accredited and assessed by
NAAC, scoring a paltry 35

marks. Sources said that the
NAAC report would not be
favourable for ASC to seek
funds from the UGC for con-
ducting refresher and orien-
tation courses in the future.

Based on the NAAC report,
the institution that has se-
cured the highest mark
would be granted a faculty
development centre, which
the Bharathidasan Univer-
sity would now be badly
missing. MORE: P3
