The two institutions (Indi-.
an and its foreign collabora-
tor) will have to enter into an
agreement which will have to
be approved by the UGC be-
fore it is implemented. The
approval will be valid for 5
years and the Commission
may review the progress
made and periodically inform
the agencies concerned about
the results of such a review.
After the expiry of this period,
the UGC may extend or with-
draw the approval or impose
such other conditions for ex-
tension, as may deem fit. The
regulations make clear that
no franchise arrangement
will be allowed.

Existing tie-ups through
the Indian institutions will
have six months to meet the

a

new cligibility criteria. In
case they fail to do so, they
will have to terminate the
agreements. Institutions that
refuse to comply with the new
regulations can lose UGC
funding, de-recognition in
case of a deemed university,
and public notices announe-
ing the ineligibility of the in-
stitution to enter into
collaborations with foreign
partners,

Disputes arising in relation
to collaboration wil] be set-
tled as per Indian laws.

As per a 2006 study by the
Association of Indian Univer-
sities, over 340 institutes
were offering courses in col-
Jaboration with foreign insti-
tutes. The UGC regulations
seek to bring some order in
area to protect students by
ensuring that only genuine
acalemic collaborations are
encouraged.
