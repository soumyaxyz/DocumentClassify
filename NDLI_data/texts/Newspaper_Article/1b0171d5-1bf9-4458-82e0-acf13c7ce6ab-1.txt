Express News Service

Tiruchy: The Bharathi-
dasan University Teachersâ€™
Association has alleged gross
irregularities in the appoint-
ment of teachers.

The president of the asso-
ciation Vasanthi Nachiappan
in a statement here charged
that 38 teaching staff were
appointed in a single day,
despite a case pending at the
Madras High Court.

She said for filling the
posts of assistant professors,
associate professors and pro-
fessors, the notification was
issued by the university on
August 25, 2012. She also al-
leged that reservation in ap-

   
    

p Eas
pointments was not adhered
to. The registrar of the Uni-
versity declined to answer
the queries of the association
on this, she charged.

The association had sub-
mitted a writ petition before
the Madurai Bench of the
Madras HC, praying for
quashing of the appoint-
ments. Though the case was
pending in the court, the
candidates were called for an

  

interview on December 3
22.

On December 22, the sj
dicate met again hurriec
and gave clearance for t
appointment of the select
candidates. The syndicat
resolution was not signed
all the members of the syn
cate and the order was issv
on a holiday, she alleged.

The dissent note made
Suguna, deputy secreta
department of higher edu
tion, the only ex-officio me
ber who attended the me
ing, was set aside by the co
mittee. She said there was
urgency in filling up of |
posts, as the academic y
was nearing its end.
