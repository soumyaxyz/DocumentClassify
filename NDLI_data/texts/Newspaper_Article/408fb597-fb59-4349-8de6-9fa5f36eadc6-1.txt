Bharathidasan Uni-
versity will publish under-
graduate examination results
ontime this year to enable stu-
dents to apply for PG pro-
grammes in other universities.
* Results for B.Com will be
announced on Wednesday,
and for BBA, BA and B.Sc. on
subsequent days, according to
the Vice Chancellor K. Meena.

Since valuation work was
carried out even during week-

ends, the university was able
to expedite valuation process.
»Results for M.A, M.Sc. and
MSW were published during
last week, she said.

At a meeting of the Senate
on Saturday, she said the sug-
gestion put forth by a member
V. Annamalai for starting the
process of computerisation of
marks at the colleges designat-
éd as examination centres
would be considered in right
earnest, though the issue of.
confidentiality has to be

addressed. .

Mr. Annamalai’s standpoint
was that the computer centres
in the colleges could be opti-
mally utilised for the purpose
of computerisation of data so
as to save time and publish re-
sults even earlier.

The university also took
note of the request made by a
member K. Anbu that the uni-
versity appoint a hall super-
visor as well along with chief
supervisor in examination
centres where the strength of

students was below 10.
The University’s Examin-

ation Reforms Committee
would present its suggestions
to the Syndicate during the
first week of July.

On behalf of the Syndicate,
the Senate members were in-
formed that the university has
taken steps to fill regular va-
cancies to the post of Controll-
er of Examination, Registrar,
Director of Centre for Dis-
tance Education and Director
of Academic Staff College.

The’ assurance was made
when some Senate members
expressed apprehensions over
the capability of In-Charge of-
ficials to devote full attention
to the vital tasks.

In deference to the requests
made by a few members, Dr.
Meena said that an announce-
ment on starting Information
Centres in constituent colleg-
es as extension units of the
Grievance Redress Cell in the
main campus will be made
shortly.
