THOUGH 15-year-old Raju had

stepped out from his nondescript vil-

lage in Jharkhand to become a gen-

tleman by working at a textile facto-

ry in Amravati district, he finished
only as-a bonded construction work-

er till his fate, along with that of
his two other co-workers, changed

with the successful rescue operation

by an NGO, Human Rights Law

Network (HRLN).

Along with Raju, one more Raju
and Mahavir were rescued in the oper-
ation conducted last Saturday night
and were presented before the medi-
apersons on Monday.

All of them have the common sur-
name of Munda and are tribals from
Jharkhand.. Two more such workers
from the same village in Jharkhand,
Pappu and Ajay had managed to escape
from the textile mill, Finlay Mills after

suffering ruthless torture perpetrated

by the contractor and his men. —
At the mill, where civil construc-

. =

  
  

‘

tion work is under way, these boys

were forced to carry construction
materials even up to the third floor.
Deplorably, these boys have to go

_ to thelocal Railway Station every morn-
Ing to ease themselves.
An FIR has been registered with

Achalpur police station in this con-
nection under Sections 23 and 26 of
the Juvenile Justice Act.

Team members of HRLN, Adv
Jatinderpal Singh Uppal, Unit
Coordinator and Achchelal Chauhan,
a social worker told newspersons that
the team swung into action after a
complaint was received from the
Jharkhand unit of their organisation
In this regard. They also alleged that
collusion of local labour officers could
not be ruled out in the case.

After getting the complaint, HRLN
contacted a local NGO, Khoj which
helped arrange the rescue operation.

Uppal and Chauhan applauded the
role of Amravati’s Police

_ Superintendent (Rural), Stalin Babu
. for his active support in the rescue

SERRATE A: ee,

 

welfare officers.. 4

   

from Jharkhand for identification of

the boys. These boys were beaten mer-
cilessly at the worksite for no reason
and were forced to work even ‘when

_ their health did not permit it.

Instead of getting Rs 150 per day

am to | pm and 2 pm to 12 mid night

as promised byzthe middleman, |

they were péid thisamount every

week only. Lo
They were made to work-from 8

 

 
    
    

and even past mid night many a times
and their daily meal consisted of rice
and potato without any variation.

The list of false promises made by
middleman is long as these boys were
told that they will be given work of
handling cloth bundles.

The contractor, who brain-washed
these boys became invisible soon after
leaving them at the work site nearly
nine montlis ago.

Even parents’ were not aware of
the fate of their children and their
pathetic condition was disclosed
only ne Pappu told them about
the entire matter after he returned to
the village.

Pappu was beaten with the rod, |
causing a deep injury on his head
and leg and he anyhow managed
to save his life by escaping from
the place.
