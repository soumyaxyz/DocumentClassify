Trichy: Residents of three girls’
hostels in Bharathidasan Uni-
versity on Wednesday protested
against the administration’s in-
efficiency in providing even ba-
sic amenities to the students. As
many as 750 women students
staged the protest against the in-
adequate water facility and fre-
quent power cuts in the hostels.

The students, residing in
three hostels—Ponni, Mullaiand
Kurinji inside the university
campus, sat in front of the hos-
tels early in the morning to raise
their voice against the water
scarcity and power crisis in the
hostels.

They complained that the ad-
ministration did not take any
step to provide them with water
for the past two months. Due to
this, they had to undergo a lot of

 

inconvenience, the students
charged.

It was the second protest by
the students since July 25, when
more than 350 students had pro-
tested against the management
for not appointing a warden for
the hostel.

and Amsaveni appeared before
the students and tried to pacify
them. Healso assured them to de-
pute a dedicated person for ma-
naging the water supply and to
provide a power generator for un-
interrupted power supply. But
they refused to disperse and
shifted their protest to the main
gate of the university.

“They exaggerated the prob-
lem. Actually, there are three bo-
rewells for providing water sup-
ply to the hostels. One of them
was not functioning yesterday
(Tuesday) due to power interrup-
tion. However, adequate water
was available in rest of the hos-
tels for all the students,” Arucha-

my told TOI.
“Even today (Wednesday), we
arranged to supply water

through trucks but the students
refused to allow the vehicles into
the campus.
