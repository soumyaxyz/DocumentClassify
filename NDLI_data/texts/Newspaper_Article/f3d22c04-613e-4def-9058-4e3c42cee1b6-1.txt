Rajkot: The paranola over
use of formalin, a known can-
cer-causing chemical, in pre-
servation of fish has not only
Tobbed people of their staple
diet but has also hit the busi-
ness hard in many states.

But fish lovers in Gujarat
won't have so much to worry
as they check whether the sea
food has formalinornot witha
simple test.

The main f\sh producing
centres like Voraval have be-
fun testing fishes using a spe-
Cial detection kit designed by
the Central Institute of Fishe
ries Technology (CIFT). The
kit, which costs just Rs 5, will
be available in the market so-
on, The kits will now be used
to detect formalin in fish pro-
duced in Surat.

Dr Toms C Joseph, princt-
pal scientist and in-charge of
Veraval Research Center of
CLIFT, told TOL “We had ex-
amined the fish produce and
ice in which the bulk ts preser-
ved in the local fish market
with the help of this kit last
week. This was jointly done
with the food and drug control
administration and now —
drive will be hy

 
  

 

The kit, which costs just Rs 5, will be available in the market soon.
Tests will be carried out in fish markets across Gujarat

How the kit works

trequires no technical

knowledge to use this kit. A
paper strip withtwo drops of
reagent solution has tobe
rubbed on the surfaceoffish
skin. If the fishis contaminated
withany chemical, the paper's
colour changes immediately.

CIFT has stated in tts In
spection report that fish in Ve-
raval market is not contaml-
nated with formaldehyde. The
popular fish species of Sau-
rashtra coast are house mack
erel, pomphret, shark, tuna,
reef cod, farmed/wild caught
shrimp and dry salted fish.

Formalin ts derived from
formaldehyde and it 1s a po-
tential cancer inducing che-
mical, harmful for human
consumption. Gopal Fofandi,
president of Akhil Gujarat
Machimar Mahamandal, sa:
id, “Our fish is not contamina-
oe with a chemical, but

assure CUStOMers
ly is abso-
mption.”

Production In Gujarat is
nearty 600 metric tonne fish
per year and almost half of
this is sent across India, The
State ts the largest producer of
marine fish in the country
while Andhra Pradesh ts the
largest producer of farm fish.

CIFT developed this con-
sumerdriendiy kit seven

* months ago on the request of

Korala government following
rampant complaints of adul-
teration.

Dr Remya §, a scientist at
the research centre, sald C
signed an MoU with Him
Laboratories Pvt Ltd for sel-
ling this kit on commercial ba-
sis. “The state food safety de-
partment can also exami:
thefish by using this kit in the
market as well as at check
posts, Eartler, we had to send
the sample for laboratory test
but the sale of fish and con-
sumption continued until the
results wereout. With the help
of this kit, now It Is possible
thatdangerous fish for human
consumption won't go into
market,” she said.
