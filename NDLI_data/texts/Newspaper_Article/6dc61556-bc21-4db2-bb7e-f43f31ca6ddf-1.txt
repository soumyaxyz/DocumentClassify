Governor grants one year extension to Anna University VC

Express News Service
Chennai, March 2

IN an unusual step that could
set a bad precedent in higher
education, Tamil Nadu Gov-
ernor Surjit Singh Barnala
has granted a year’s exten-
sion to Anna University Vice-
Chancellor P Mannar Jawa-
har, nearly four months
ahead of the expiry of the
latter’s tenure. The decision
has rattled senior academi-
cians in Tamil Nadu.
Jawahar had assumed
charge as Vice-Chancellor of

the premier university on
June 27, 2008. His tenure was
to have ended on the same
day this year, by when a new
Government would be in
place. However, now he will
continue till June 2012.
Normally a search commit-
tee comprising a nominee
each of the university’s syn-
dicate, academic senate and
the Governor-Chancellor is
constituted before the expiry
of a V-C’s tenure in order to
shortlist three probable can-
didates, of whom the Gover-
nor appoints one. Barnala

has done away with this
procedure and opted to exer-
cise his powers under the
statute by granting a year’s
extension to Jawahar, just
before the Asseinbly elec-
tions.

“Yes the rules Jo permit
the Governor to allow an in-
cuibent Vice-Cliancellor
to continue for a year beyond
his tenure. But such a
decision is taken only
under extraordinar y circum-
stances like unrest on the
campus or where the situa-
tion is not conducive for a

smooth transition. Certainly,
we don’t have such an abnor-
mal situation now,” argued
a former V-C of the Univer-
sity.

“The Governor has set a
bad precedent. Political par-
ties will from now on use this
to manipulate the term of a
Vice-Chancellor,” he
warned.

Although Jawahar is rega-
rded as a clean and non-con-
troversial person, as an ad-
ministrator, sources say, it is
not clear if he is immune to
political pressure.

Asenior academic adminis-
trator said the Governor's of-
fice would possibly justify its
decision of not constituting a
search committee citing the
election model code of con-
duct. “However, nothing pre-
vents the formation of a
search committee after the
polls, or they could have done
it earlier,” he said.

Another academician
pointed out that since
the Government has no role
in the constitution of
asearch committee, the Gov-
ernor should have followed

the normal process of selec-
tion.

“Even if the search com-
mittee cannot be constituted
on time, there is a provision
for a syndicate sub-commit-
tee to administrate the uni-
versity till a successor is
named. Such a sub-cominit-
tee had handled the affairs of
the Anna University in the
absence of a Vice-Chancellor
five years ago.

The Bharathiar University
too did not have a Vice-Chan-
cellor for close to a year,” he
explained.
