Tiruchy: Denying charges
of irregularities against
Bharathidasan University by
a section of employees, the
university asserted that no
CBCID enquiry was war-
ranted. The allegation that
printing orders were given to
a press on the recommenda-
tion of a DMK bigwig result-
ing ina loss of 1 crore to the
university is ‘baseless’.

It denied the charge that
the university was unable to
use the graduation certifi-
cates as the press had print-
ed its name on them. While
terming those allegations as
‘totally false’, the university

. added that “very few errors
were pointed out by the Con-
troller of Examinations and
fresh graduation certificates
were supplied by the same

“press, the printing press
bearing the expenses.”

No financial loss was sus-
tained by the University or
any difficulty in issuing certi-
ficates experienced by the
University. The tender for
body building of the bus chas-
sis was entrusted to two dif-

ferent “builders of repute,” it

said. Referring to the charges
that the PRO himself “kept
the cheque” to be given to the
companies against the uni-
versity norms of sending che-
ques through post, the state-
ment said the allegation that
the PRO demanded @2 lakh
from the builders for “hand-
ing over the cheque” is false.
On charges of not appoint-
ing temporary junior assis-
tants through employment
exchange, it said “only 16
junior assistants were ap-
pointed. List of candidates
was asked through employ-
ment exchange twice and no
candidate was approved by
the selection committee”.
The statement with regard to
the departments without
students “is exaggerated”.
On allegations of eight
drivers bypassing the em-
ployment exchange, the uni-
versity said “the employment
exchange list was called for
and the persons listed as
candidates and sent by the
employment exchange was
found not fit.” On charges of
cutting down of trees and the
university losing its green
cover, the university said
“only eucalyptus trees that

are aged and to be harvested
and trees found to be cut
down for building purposes
had been cut as per recom-
mendations of the Estate
Maintenance Department”.
The university refuted the
allegations of corruption
with regard to BEd admis-
sion in Centre for Distance
Education and termed them
as “not true”. On allegations
of extending the tenure of
the present Registrar, it said
“the extension has been giv-
en only till the new Registrar
is appointed.” The statement
signed by the University
Registrar also denied that
the Public Relations Officer
V Rajagopal demanded and
obtained money from the
press to clear the tender.
The Vice-Chancellor and
PRO quoting higher amounts
for order and demanding a
share of 40 per cent was
false, it said. Rajagopal was
posted as PRO by Dr N Ra-
manujam, who was holding
charges as Vice-Chancellor,
prior to the date of assump-
tion of present Vice-Chancel-
lor Dr K Meena and she had
not threatened anyone for
anything. |
