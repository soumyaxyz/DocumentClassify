26726. Adulteration and misbranding of Lassar’s zine paste. S. v. Price
Drug Co., Inc. Plea of guilty, Fine, $50. (F. & D. no. yas, Sample
no, 43077—A.)

This product contained salicylic acid in a proportion less than that pre-
scribed for Lassar’s Zinc Paste in the National Formulary.

On February 2, 1936, the United States attorney for the Southern District
of New York, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court an information against the Price Drug Co., Inc., New York, N. Y.,
charging shipment by said corporation in violation of the Food and Drugs Act,
on or about November 23, 1933, from the State of New York into the State
of Connecticut of a quantity of Lassar’s zinc paste that was adulterated and
misbranded.

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it was sold under and by
a name recognized in the National Formulary and differed from the standard
of strength, quality, and purity as determined by the test laid down in said
formulary, since said article contained less than 2 grams of salicylic acid per
100 grams of the article; whereas said formulary provided that Lassar’s zinc
paste should contain not less than 2 grams of salicylic acid per 100 grams.

The article was alleged to be misbranded in that the statement “Lassar’s
Zinc Paste (N. F.)”, borne on the label, was false and misleading since it
represented that said article was Lassar’s zine paste, which conformed to the
standard laid down in the National Formulary; whereas in fact said article
was not Lassar’s zine paste that conformed to the standard laid down in the
National Formulary.

On May 11, 1936, a plea of guilty was entered on behalf of defendant cor-
poration and the court imposed a fine of $50.

Dakota, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the’

of the Food and Drugs Act as amended, on or about January 14 and February
14, 1935, from the State of North Dakota into the State of Minnesota of a
quantity of Sip-O that was misbranded.

‘Analysis of the article showed that it consisted essentially of water, sugar,
menthol, chloroform, and a small amount of pine tar and unidentified plant
extractives.

its curative or therapeutic effects, “* * * for Coughs * * *”, and
“A Valuable Remedy for Coughs * * * Bronchitis, Bronchial Asthma,
