These cases involved various shipments of canned soaked dry peas which
were misbranded because of the design on the label depicting a dish of succu-
lent green peas.

On November 5, 1932, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Ohio, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the district
court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 300 cases of canned peas at
Toledo, Ohio. Between the dates of November 9 and December 21, 1932, libels
were filed against 46414 cases of the product at St. Louis, Mo., 170 cases at
Denver, Colo., 107 cases at Wichita, Kans., 296 cases at Detroit, Mich., 85 cases
at Chicago, Ill., 96 cases at San Antonio, Tex., 148 cases at Newburg, N. Y.,
and 400 cases at Kingston, N. Y. The libels charged that the article had been

of a dish of succulent green peas.

Joseph S. Morgan and Ivan C. Morgan, copartners, trading as the Morgan
Packing Co., Austin, Ind., appeared as claimant and filed answers to the libels
denying that the product was misbranded and praying its release. Amended
libels were subsequently filed in all cases.

Illinois, and Western District of Texas, was alleged to be misbranded in that
