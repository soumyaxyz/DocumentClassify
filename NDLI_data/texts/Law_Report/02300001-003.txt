24401. Adulteration of canned shrimp. U.S. v. 283 Cases of Canned
rimp. Decree of condemnation. Product released under bond
conditioned that decomposed portions be destroyed. (F. & D.

no. 34428. Sample no. 2266-B.)

This case involved an interstate shipment of canned shrimp which was in
part decomposed.

On November 22, 1934, the United States attorney for the Eastern District
of Michigan, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 283 cases of canned
shrimp at Detroit, Mich., alleging that the article had been shipped in inter-
state commerce on or about October 3, 1934, by the Dorgan-McPhillips Pack-
ing Corporation, from Biloxi, Miss., and charging adulteration in violation of
the Food and Drugs Act. The article was labeled in part: “Gulf Kist Brand
Faney Large Shrimp * * * Packed by Dorgan-McPhillips Packing Corp.
Mobile, Ala.”’

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it consisted wholly or in
part of a decomposed animal substance.

On March 22, 1935, the Dorgan-McPhillips Packing Corporation, claimant,
having admitted the allegations of the libel, judgment of condemnation was
entered and it was ordered that the product be released under bond conditioned
that the decomposed portions be segregated and destroyed.

24402. Adulteration of apples. U. S. v. 628 Bushels and 1,376 Bushels of
Apples. Decrees of condemnation. Product released under bond con-
ditioned that deleterious substances be removed. (F. & D. nos, 34410,
34667. Sample nos, 2244-B, 2270-B, 2272-B, 2278-B, 2275-B, 2280-B.)

Examination of the apples involved in these cases showed the presence of
arsenic and lead in amounts that might have rendered them injurious to health.

On October 24 and November 21, 1934, the United States attorney for the
Eastern District of Michigan, acting upon reports by the Secretary of Agricul-
ture, filed in the district court libels praying seizure and condemnation of
1,904 bushels of apples at Detroit, Mich., alleging that the article had been
shipped in interstate commerce between the dates of September 28 and October
9, 1934, by W. R. MacClew, from Medina, N. Y., and charging adulteration in
violation of the Food and Drugs Act.

‘The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it contained added poisonous
or deleterious ingredients, arsenic and lead, which might have rendered it
harmful to health.

In February 1935, the Frigid Food Products Co., Detroit, Mich., claimant,
having admitted the allegations of the libels, judgments of condemnation were
entered and it was ordered that the apples be released under bond conditioned
that they be peeled to remove the deleterious substances.
