Bihar Money-Lenders Act, 1938 (Bihar Act No. UI
of 1938), 5. 11—Bihdr Money-Lenders (Regula-
tion of Transactions) Act, 1939 (Bihar Act No.
VII of 1939), 5. 7—Whether appellants entitled to
benefit of s. 7 of new Act—Validity of s.. 11 of Act
of 1938.

Section 11 of the Bihar Money-Lenders Act, 1938 (No. III
of 1938) has been re-enacted as s. 7 of the Bihar Act No. VII
of 1939 ; and as this Act was passed in conformity with the
procedure prescriked in s. 107(2) of the Constitution Act, its
validity is not open to question. Section 7 of the new Act in
terms made applicable to suits instituted before the commence-
ment of the Act. The appellants were accordingly held entitled
to claim the benefit of the section, and it was unnecessary to
consider whether s. 11 of the Act of 1938 was void or not.

APPEAL from the High Court at Patna,

Raghbir Singh (A. C. Roy with him) for the
appellants. The respondent did not appear.

The facts appear sufficiently from the Judgment.
: , Cur. adv. vult.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by

Gwyer C. J.—This appeal arises out of a suit
instituted by the respondent for the recovery of
money claimed to be due under a mortgage bond
executed in his favour by some of the appellants on
April 16, 1921. The other defendants are minor
metmbers of the mortgagors’ family. The bond
provided for payment of compound interest at
Rs. 1-4-0 per cent. per mensem with yearly rests.
Certain of the defendants did not contest the case,
but the others put the plaintiff to proof of his claim
generally; they also contended that the rate of interest
was excessive and not justified by necessity.
