Dear Shri Bhradwaj ji,

I have great pleasure in forwarding the 192% Report of the Law
Commission on ‘Prevention of Vexatious Litigation’ in our High Courts and
Courts subordinate to the High Courts. Earlier, law on this subject was
enacted in the former State of Madras and has been in force as the Madras
Vexatious Litigation (Prevention) Act, 1949, and also in the State of
Maharashtra wherein it is called the Maharashtra Vexatious Litigation
(Prevention) Act, 1971 but similar enactments have not been enacted in the
other States. The Law Commission, in its 189" Report on ‘Revision of Court
Fee Structure’ (2004) has also recommended enacting a law on the subject
by the Parliament. The Commission has, therefore, taken up the subject in
detail in this Report. It has made an in depth study of the matter as enforced
in different jurisdictions.

The validity of the aforesaid Madras Act of 1949 was upheld by the
Supreme Court of India in P.H. Mawle vs. State of A.P.: (AIR 1965 SC
1827) and the Court pointed out the advantages of having such a law. It may
be observed that the Madras Act of 1949 and the Maharashtra Act of 1971
are based upon an old statute of England of 1896 and the law declared in
Grepe vs. Loam (1879) 39 ChD 168. Several improvements have been
made in the law in that country, the latest provisions being sec 42 of the
(UK) Supreme Court Act, 1981. Under that Act, the English Courts have
decided a number of cases. In Attorney General vs. Banker 2000(1) F.L.R.
759, Lord Bingham explained the meaning of the words ‘habitually and
persistently’ used in sec 42. The European Court in Application 11559 of
1985, H vs. UK: (1985) D&R 281 has also upheld the Vexatious Actions
(Scot Law) Act, 1898. The Ebert series of cases from 1999 to 2001 and the
