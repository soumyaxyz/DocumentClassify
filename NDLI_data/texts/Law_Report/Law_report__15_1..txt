N entered into an underwriting agreement with an insur-
ance company in respect of 30,000 shares. He owed the com-
pany Rs. 1,10,000 on the underwriting agreement, and owed
further amounts on other accounts. N borrowed Re. 25,000
from a Bank on a promissory note pledging 26,000 shares and
gave blank transfer forms to the Bank. Later on N borrowed a
further sum of Rs. 50,000 pledging the same shares and was in-
