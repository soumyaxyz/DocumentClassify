ADULTERATION AND MISBRANDING OF APPLE BUTTER.

On or about March 17, 1909, the St. Louis Syrup and Preserving
Company, St. Louis, Mo., shipped from the State of Missouri to the
State of Kentucky a quantity of a food product labeled “ Clymer’s
Brand Apple Butter. Absolutely Pure, St. Louis Syrup & Preserv-
ing Co., St. Louis, Mo.” and on or about November 9, 1909, said
company shipped. from the State of Missouri to the State of Okla-
homa a quantity of apple butter, part of which was labeled “ Clymer’s
Brand Apple Butter. Absolutely Pure, St. Louis Syrup & Pre-
serving Co. Net 16 oz. U. S. Serial No. 8563.” and part of which
bore label identical with that on the shipment of March 17 above
referred to. Samples of these shipments were procured and analyzed
by the Bureau of Chemistry. United States Department of Agricul-
ture, and as the findings of the analyst and report thereon indicated
that the product was adulterated and misbranded within the mean-
ing of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30. 1906, the said St. Louis
Syrup and Preserving Company and the parties from whom the
samples were procured were afforded opportunities for hearings.
As it appeared after hearings held that the said shipments were
made in violation of the act, the Secretary of Agriculture reported
the facts to the Attorney-General, with a statement of the evidence
upon which to base a prosecution.

In due course three criminal informations were filed in the Dis-
trict Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri
against the said St. Louis Syrup and Preserving Company charging
the above shipments and alleging that the product first above men-
tioned was adulterated, in that it contained 6.13 per cent of glucose,
which had been mixed and packed with the product so as to reduce,
lower, and injuriously affect its quality, and in that the said glucose
had been substituted in part for the article described in the label
