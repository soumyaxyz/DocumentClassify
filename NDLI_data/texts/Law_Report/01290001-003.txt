NOTICE OF JUDGMENT NO. 451, FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.

ADULTERATION OF CREAM.

On or about April 16, 1910, George M. Kephart, of Derwood, Md.,
sold and delivered at the Union Station, Washington, D. C., a quan-
tity of alleged cream. Dr. William C. Woodward, health officer of
the District of Columbia, acting on authority of the Secretary of
Agriculture, caused samples of the above delivery to be procured and
analyzed. As the findings of the analyst and report made indicated
that the cream was adulterated within the meaning of the Food and
Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, the said George M. Kephart was afforded
an opportunity for hearing. As it appeared after hearing held that
the shipment was made in violation of the act, the said health officer
reported the facts to the United States attorney for the District of
Columbia.

In due course a criminal information was filed against the said
George M. Kephart in the Police Court of the District of Columbia,
charging that the cream was adulterated in that a valuable constitu-
ent of said article of food, to wit, butter fat, had been left out and
abstracted wholly or in part.

On May 12, 1910, the defendant entered ‘a plea of guilty to the
information, and the court imposed a fine of $10.

This notice is given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs
Act of June 30, 1906.
