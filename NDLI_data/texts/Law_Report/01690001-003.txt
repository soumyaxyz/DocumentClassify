acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District
Court of the United States for said district a libel for the seizure and con-
demnation of 50 wooden cases of beans in tomato sauce, remaining unsold
in the original unbroken packages at New Albany, Ind., alleging that the
article had been shipped on or about February 16, 1916, by the Rossville Can-
ning Co., Rossville, Tl., and transported from the State of Illinois into the
State of Indiana, and charging adulteration in violation of the Food and
Drugs Act, The article was labeled in part: ‘“ Frisco Brand Luncheon Beans
in Tomato Sauce * * * Rossville Canning Co., Rossville, Ill.”

reason that it had been colored, whereby inferiority was concealed; and for the
further reason that it consisted, in whole or in part, of decomposed vegetable
substance,

On February 15, 1917. no claimant having appeared for the property, judg-
ment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, and it was ordered by the
court that the product be destroyed by the United States marshal.
