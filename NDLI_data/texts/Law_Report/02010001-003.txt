19351-19400

[Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., November 12, 1932]

19351. Misbranding of Morrison’s Old English liniment, U.S. v. 11 Pack-
ages, et al., of Morrison’s Old English Liniment. Default decree
of condemnation, forfeiture, and destruction. (F. & D. No. 26945.
I. 8. Nos. 34468, 34469. 8. No. 5155.)

Examination of the drug product Morrison’s Old English liniment, involved
in this action, showed that the carton and bottle labels and a circular shipped
with the article contained statements representing that it possessed curative
and therapeutic properties which, in fact, it did not possess.

On September 8, 1931, the United States attorney for the District of Massa-
chusetts, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
District Court of the United States for the district aforesaid a libel praying
seizure and condemnation of 11 large bottles and 22 small bottles of Mor-
rison’s Old English liniment, remaining in the original unbroken packages
at Boston, Mass., alleging that the article had been shipped by the James
W. Foster Co., of Bath, N. H., from Lisbon, N. H., on or about July 24,
1931, and had been transported from the State of New Hampshire into the
State of Massachusetts, and charging misbranding in violation of the food and
drugs act as amended.

Analysis of a sample of the article by this department showed that it con-
sisted essentially of a nonvolatile oil such as fish oil and volatile oils such
as pine-tar oil, turpentine oil, and kerosene.

It was alleged in the libel that the article was misbranded in that the fol-
lowing statements regarding the curative or therapeutic effects of the said
article, appearing in the labeling, were false and fraudulent, since it con-
tained no ingredient or combination of ingredients capable of producing the
effects claimed: (Carton, small size) “ Used Externally For Contracted, Hard,
