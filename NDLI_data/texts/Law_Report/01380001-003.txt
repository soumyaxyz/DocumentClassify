ADULTERATION OF OYSTERS.

On December 7, 1911, the United States Attorney for the District
of Columbia, acting upon.a report by the Secretary of Agriculture,
filed in the Police Court of said District an information against E. H.
Hayden, Abels, Md., alleging that said defendant, on September 9,
1910, at the District aforesaid, sold, in violation of the Food and
Drugs Act, a quantity of oysters in shell which were adulterated.
The product bore no label.

Examination of samples of the product by the Bureau of Chem-
istry of this Department showed the following results: The com-
posite sample showed the presence of 530,000 organisms on plain
agar after 3 days’ incubation at 25° C.; 430,000 organisms on
plain agar after 3 days’ incubation at 37° C.; 100 gas-producing
organisms in bile fermentation tubes at 37° C. Fifteen oysters out
of 15 showed gas in 1 cc quantities in bile fermentation tubes after
3 days’ incubation at 37° C.; 14 oysters out of 15 in 0.1 cc quantities;
12 oysters out of 15 in 0.01 cc quantities; 6 oysters out of 15 in
0.001 cc quantities, showing that the product consists wholly or
in part of a filthy, putrid, or decomposed animal substance. Adul-
teration of the product was alleged in the information for the reason
that it consisted in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed or
putrid animal and vegetable substance.

On December 7, 1911, defendant entered a plea of not guilty. On
January 6, 1912, a plea to the jurisdiction of the court was filed,
argued, and overruled, and defendant was released on $15 collateral.
On July 25, 1912, the defendant having failed to appear to answer to
the information, the said collateral was forfeited.
