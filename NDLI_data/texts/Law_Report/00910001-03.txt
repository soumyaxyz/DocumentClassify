PROSECUTIONS AND SEIZURES UNDER THE FEDERAL SEED ACT
(July 1, 1962 to June 30, 1963) (544-578)

544, False labeling of noxious-weed seeds, excessive noxious-
weed seeds, and failure to keep a complete record. U. S. v.
Vollstedt's, Inc., Albany, Oregon. (FS 861)

Vollstedt's, Inc., on September 30, 1957, delivered for trans-
portation from Albany, Oregon, to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 10
bags of chewings fescue seed.

A complaint was filed in U. S. District Court for the District
of Oregon alleging that Vollstedt's, Inc., delivered for trans-
portation in interstate commerce 10 bags of the seed in violation
of the Federal Seed Act.

The seed had a false labeling in that labels attached to the bags
represented the seed to contain no noxious-weed seeds; whereas,

the seed was found to contain sheep sorrel seeds at the rate of 806
per pound. Sheep sorrel seeds are considered noxious-weed seeds

in the State of Oklahoma, It is required under the Federal Seed
Act, by reason of the Oklahoma State law and regulations, that
agricultural seed shipped into that State shall be labeled to show
the name and number per pound of such noxious-weed seeds.

Agricultural seed containing in excess of 500 sheep sorrel seeds
per pound is prohibited from sale in the State of Oklahoma and
therefore is prohibited from shipment into that State under the
Federal Seed Act.

A complete record of the purity of the seed, including a file
sample, was not kept by the interstate shipper as required by
the Federal Seed Act and regulations thereunder.

On November 2, 1962, a judgment in the amount of $75 plus costs
was entered against Vollstedt's, Inc.
