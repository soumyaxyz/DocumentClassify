DO No.6(3)82/2002-LC(LS) February 25, 2004

Dear Shri Arun Jaitley ji,

I have great pleasure in forwarding the 189" Report of the Law Commission on
‘Revision of Court Fees Structure’. The Commission took up the subject on a reference
received from the Dept. of Legal Affairs vide OM No.A-60011/14/2003 Admn.IIT.LA
dated Feb. 11, 2003. In fact, the Dept. of Justice vide its letter No.L-11018/1/2002-Jus.
dated 29.8.2002 made a request to the Dept. of Legal Affairs for referring the matter of
“upward revision of Court fees structure vis-a-vis the need to build financial disincentives
to discourage vexatious litigation’, to the Law Commission for consideration. The Dept.
of Justice, as mentioned in its letter, is of the view that the Court fees in majority of cases
has not been revised for a very long time, although valuation of rupee has come down,
and currently it covers only a fraction of the administrative costs of the judicial process.

This being the first occasion for the Law Commission to give a Report exclusively
on subject of Court fees, the basic principles in regard to the collection of Court fee, have
been elaborately discussed in this Report.

The Law Commission examined the issue of Court fee in the light of the modern
concept that the right of access to justice, is a ‘basic right’ and dealt with this aspect in
Chapter II of the Report. The Commission is of the firm view that as the right to access
to justice is now recognized as a basic human right world over, high rates of Court fee
may become a barrier to access to justice and this view is shared today in all the countries
governed by the common law and civil law systems of jurisprudence.
