The labeling of this product bore false and fraudulent curative and thera-
peutic claims.

On August 26, 1936, the United States attorney for the District of New
Jersey, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the district
court an information against the Ampere Products Co., a corporation, West
Orange, N. J., alleging shipment by said company in violation of the Food and
Drugs Act as amended, on or about April 17, 1935, from the State of New
Jersey into the State of Massachusetts of a quantity of Apco No. 20 that was
misbranded.

Analysis showed that the article consisted of sodium hypochlorite, sodium
chloride, sodium carbonate, and water (93.10 percent).

It was alleged to be misbranded in that certain statements borne on the jug
label and contained in an accompanying circular falsely and fraudulently repre-
sented that it was effective as a treatment, cure, and preventive of disease in
poultry and livestock; as a treatment and remedy for abortion, cowpox, garget,
scours, barrenness, retention of afterbirth, and many other diseases in cattle;
as a treatment for diseases of swine and as a preventive of cholera in swine; as
a treatment and remedy for coccidiosis, cholera, white diarrhoea, and roup in
poultry, and as a preventive of blackhead in poultry.

The information also charged misbranding of this product and several other
products in violation of the Insecticide Act of 1910 reported in Notice of Judg-
ment No. 1556 published under that date.

On June 25, 1937, the oetendane entered a plea of guilty to all charges and
the court imposed a fine of $25 on each count of the information. Payment of
fine was Suspended on certain counts, which included the count charging viola-
tion of the Food and Drugs Act, and the defendant was placed on probation for
a period of 1 year.
