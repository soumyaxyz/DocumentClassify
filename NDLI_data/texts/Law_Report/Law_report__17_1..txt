consideration in these appeals. Applications have
been filed by some of the appellants under s. 205 (2)
of the Government of India Act craving our permis-
sion to raise grounds other than those upon which cer-
tificates under s. 205 (1) were granted. Learned coun-
sel, however, very frankly admitted that he was unable
tosay that any substantial error of law was involved
in any of these cases or there has been any irregularity
in the procedure which .has led to miscarriage of
justice. This being the position, we declined to enter
into questions of fact which were discussed elaborately
in the judgments of the High Court. The result is
that the appeals fail and are dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

Agent for the Appellants: P. K. Chatterjee.
