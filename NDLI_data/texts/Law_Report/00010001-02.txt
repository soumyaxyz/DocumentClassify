Chairman, Law Commission of India

 

No.6(3)(54)/99-LC(LS) February 26, 1999

Dear Dr. M. Thambi Durai,

I am sending herewith 167th Report on "The
Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1998".

2. The Law Commission had taken  up_ the
aforesaid subject suo motu in view of the
fundamental importance of the provisions contained
in the aforesaid Bill and notwithstanding the fact
that it has already been passed by the Rajya
Sabha. This unusual step has been taken in view
of certain significant omissions in the Bill,
which impinge seriously upon our national
interest. .

3. The recommendations contained in the Report
may be considered by the Government and Parliament
while debating the said Amendment Bill in the
Budget Session.

With regards,

Yours sincerely,
A aN

(B.P. Jeevan Reddy)
