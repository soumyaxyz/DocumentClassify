purchase in the year 1906 and validly transferred it
to the idol in the year 1909. Once we hold that the

property was validly transferred to the idol and sarvaxanass

vested in it, the kabuliat (Exhibit 3) executed by
defendant no. 8 in favour of the plaintifls will be of
no ayail, and we must construe it as having been
executed by the shebait for the benefit of the idol.
The view taken by the learned Subordinate Judge was
correct. Apart from the validity of the transfer,
Lam of opinion that the question vannot be raised by
the plaintiff in the present suit. A transfer of a
non-transferable occupancy holding is not void but
voidable. The suit to avoid it had hecome barred
when the present suit was instituted, nor is the suit
framed on. that basis.

I would allow this uppeal with costs, reverse the
decree of the learned District Judge and restore that
of the learned Subordinate J udge. The plaintiffs
will pay the costs of defendant uo, 1 of une lower
appellate court also.

Lusy, T.--L agree.
Appeal allowed.
