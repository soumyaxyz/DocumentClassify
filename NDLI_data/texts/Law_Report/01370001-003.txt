ADULTERATION OF CATSUP.

On November 4, 1912, the United States Attorney for the District
of Maryland. acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture,
filed in the District Court of the United States for said district an
information against the S. J. Van Lill Co., a corporation, Baltimore.
Md., alleging shipment by said company, in violation of the Food
and Drugs Act. on December 5, 1910. from the State of Maryland
into the District of Columbia of a quantity of catsup which was
adulterated. The product was labeled: (On barrel head) “47 Wilson
Brand Catsup Tomato Pulp Trimmings. Spice. Grain Vinegar, + of
1% Benzoate of Sodium. S. J. Van Lill Co., Baltimore, Md. H. B.
Terrett, Washington, D. C.”

of this Department showed it to be sterile and that it contained
yeasts and spores 104 per one-sixtieth cmm, bacteria 117.000.000
per cc, mold filaments in 84 per cent of the fields. ‘ Adulteration of
the product was alleged in the information for the reason that it

guilty to the information and the court imposed a fine of $15.
