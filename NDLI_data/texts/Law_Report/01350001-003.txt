ADULTERATION OF OYSTERS

On March 4, 1912, the United States Attorney for the District of
Columbia, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed
in the Supreme Court for said District, holding a district court, a
libel for the seizure and condemnation of 750 bushels, more or iess, of
oysters in shell, remaining unsold and in possession of Arthur H.
Wells, upon the sloop John Branford, Eleventh Street Wharf, Wash-
ington, D. C., alleging that the product had been transported from
the State of Virginia into the District of Columbia, date of ship-
ment not shown, and charging adulteration in violation of the Food
and Drugs Act. Adulteration was alleged in the libel for the reason
that the product consisted jn part of a filthy, decomposed, and pu-
trid ‘animal or vegetable substance, for which reason it was abso-
lutely unfit for human consumption.

On March 7, 1912, Arthur H. Wells, claimant, having filed his
plea and answer consenting to a decree, and having paid the costs of
the proceedings, judgment of condemnation and forfeiture was en-
tered, and it was further ordered that, upon the execution and deliv-
ery of bond by said claimant, in conformity with section 10 of the
Act, fixed by the court at $100, the product should be released and
delivered to said claimant.
