[Approved by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., August 31, 1954}

22001. Misbranding of Sal-Tonik. U. S.
Sal-Tonik, et al. Default deer
and destruction. (F,
014130 incl. Sample nos. 1221 to 1824,

This case involved various shipments of Sal-Tonik, the labels of which
contained unwarranted curative and therapeutic claims.

On December 6, 1928, the United States attorney for the District of South
Dakota, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court libels praying seizure and condemnation of one hundred and
twenty-three 50-pound blocks of Sal-Tonik, in various lots at Tripp, Fedora,
Parkston, and Kaylor, S.Dak., respectively, alleging that the article had been
shipped in interstate commerce between the dates of April 7 and June 30, 1928,
by the Guaran Veterinary Co., from Sioux City, Iowa, and charging mis-
branding in violation of the Food and Drugs Act as amended. The labels of
the article bore the same curative and therapeutic claims as the labels of the
product covered by Notice of Judgment no. 16793.

Analysis of a sample of the article by this Department showed that it con-
sisted essentially of 87.8 percent of sodium chloride, 4.2 percent calcium car-
bonate, and small proportions of sulphur, paraffin, an iron compound, and
sulphates.

It was alleged in the libels that the article was misbranded in that certain
statements regarding its curative and therapeutic effects, appearing on the
labels, were false and fraudulent, since the article contained no ingredient
or combination of ingredients capable of producing the effects claimed.

On February 27, 1934, no claimant having appeared for the property, judg-
ments of condemnation and forfeiture were entered, and it was ordered by the
court that the product be destroyed by the United States marshal.

M. L. Witson, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

22002. Adulteration and misbranding of Zepyrol. U.S. v. 44 Packages and
22 Packages of Zepyrol. Default decree of condemnation, for-
feiture, and destruction. (F. & D. no, 31559. Sample nos. 56258-A,
56259-A,)

Examination of the drug product, Zepyrol, disclosed that it contained no
ingredient or combination of ingredients capable of producing certain curative
and therapeutic effects claimed in the labeling. Tests of the article also showed
that it was not an antiseptic and germicide, as claimed.

On November 15, 1933, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Texas, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the dis-
trict court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of forty-four 14-ounce
packages and twenty-two 6-ounce packages of Zepyrol at Dallas, Tex., alleging
that the article had been shipped in interstate commerce in part on or about
June 8, 1933, from Chula Vista, Calif., and in. part on or about October 9, 1933,
from Los Angeles, Calif., and that it was adulterated and misbranded in vio-
lation of the Food and Drugs Act as amended. The article was labeled in
part: “Zepyrol * * * Stearns-Hollinshead Co. Inc. Portland, Oregon.”
