NOTICES OF JUDGMENT UNDER THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.

[Given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs Act.]

11651, Adulteration of canned minced clams. WU. S. v. 192 Cases of Minced
Clams. Consent decree of condemnation and forfeiture. Prod-
uct released under bond. (F. & D. No, 16609. I. 8. No, 14062-t.
8. No. W-1152.)

On July 11, 1922, the United States attorney for the District of Oregon, act-
ing upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District Court
of the United States for said district a libel praying the seizure and condemna-
tion of 192 cases of minced clams, remaining in the original unbroken packages
at Portland, Oreg., alleging that the article had been shipped by the Strand
Fisheries, from Aberdeen, Wash., May 25, 1922, and transported from the State
of Washington into the State of Oregon, and charging adulteration in violation
of the Food and Drugs Act. The article was labeled in part: (Can) ‘“ Royal
Club Brand * * * Minced Clams.”

Adulteration of the article was alleged in the libel for the reason that exces-
sive water or clam juice had been mixed and packed therewith so as to reduce
and lower and injuriously affect its quality and strength and had been sub-
stituted wholly or in part for normal minced clams of good commercial quality.

On September 28, 1922, the Kelley-Clarke Co., Portland, Oreg., having
appeared as claimant for the property and having consented to the entry of a
decree, judgment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, and it was
ordered by the court that the product be released to the said claimant upon
payment of the costs of the proceedings and the execution of a good and suffi-
cient bond, in conformity with section 10 of the act.

Howarp M. Gors, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

Truckers’ Assoe.). Plen of guilty. Fine, $25. (F. & D. No. 16964.
I. 8, No. 18131-t.)
On February 21, 1923, the United States attorney for the Northern District
labama, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
t Court of the United States for said district an information against
Alvin H, Peinhardt, trading as Cullman Truckers’ Assoc., Cullman, Ala., alleg-
ing shipment by said defendant, in violation of the Food and Drugs Act, as
amended, on or about April 28, 1922, from the State of Alabama into the State
of Pennsylvania, of a quantity of sweet potatoes which were misbranded.
Misbranding of the article was alleged in the information for the reason
that it was food in package form, and the quantity of the contents was not
plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the package.
On March 21, 1923, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the information,
and the court imposed a fine of $25.
