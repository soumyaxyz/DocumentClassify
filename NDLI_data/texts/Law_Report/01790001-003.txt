NOTICES OF JUDGMENT UNDER THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.

[Given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs Act.]

11301. Adulteration of shell eggs. U. S. v. Collins Produce Co., a Corpora-
pions) pes of guilty. Fine, $10 and costs. (F. & D. No, 16400. I. S. No.
On June 27, 1922, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Ili-

nois, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District

Court of the United States for said district an information against the Collins

Produce Co., a corporation, Flora, Ill., alleging shipment by said company in

violation of the Food and Drugs Act, on or about August 12, 1921, from the

State of Illinois into the State of New York, of a quantity of shell eggs which

were adulterated.

Examination by the Bureau of Chemistry of this department of 5 half cases
from the consignment showed that 95, or 10.5 per cent of those examined, were
inedible eggs.

Adulteration of the article was alleged in the information for the reason
that it consisted in part of a filthy, decomposed, and putrid animal substance.

On October 6, 1922, a plea of guilty to the information was entered on behalf
of the defendant company, and the court imposed a fine of $10 and costs.

On or about July 19 and 28, 1922, respectively, the United States attorney
for the Eastern District of North Carolina, acting upon reports by the Secretary
of Agriculture, filed in the District Court of the United States for said district
libels praying the seizure and condemnation of 28 tins of chloroform, remain-
ing in the original unbroken packages in part at Southport and in part at
Wendell, N. C., alleging that the article had been shipped from New York, N. ¥.,
in part on or about March 13 and in part on or about April 18, 1922, and
transported from the State of New York into the State of North Carolina, and
charging adulteration in violation of the Food and Drugs Act. The article was
labeled in part: “ Chloroform for Anesthesia.”

department showed that it was turbid, that upon evaporation it left a foreign
odor, and that it contained hydrochloric acid, impurities decomposable by

| ‘sulphuric acid, and chlorinated decomposition products.
| Adulteration of the article was alleged in the libels for the reason that
it was sold under and by a name recognized in the United States Pharma-
