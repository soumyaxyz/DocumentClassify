D.O.No.6(3)75/2002-LC(LS) June 1, 2004

Dear Shri Bharadwaj ji,

I have a great pleasure in forwarding the 190" Report of Law Commission of
India on ‘Revision of the Insurance Act, 1938 and the Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority Act, 1999’. The Commission took up the subject at the instance
of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) which vide its letter dated
og” April 2002 had requested the Commission to make recommendations for the revision
of the Insurance Act, 1938.

2. The insurance sector has been growing steadily and is a major source of long term
contractual funds needed for infrastructure development. With the liberalisation of
economic policy, the insurance sector is now open for private sector also along with up to
26% of foreign equity participation. In this changing economic scenario, the IRDA has
to play a vital role for the regulation and development of insurance business. Therefore,
the Commission is of the view that the Insurance Act, 1938 requires review and revision.
But the revision of the Act has to be carried out in such a manner that it should not only
promote insurance business but also protect the interests of policyholders and strengthen
the IRDA to ensure financial stability in this sector.

3. After a series of discussion held with the IRDA, the Law Commission prepared an
exhaustive Consultation Paper in the month of June, 2003 which was also placed on the
Commission’s website in the same month. Copies thereof were also sent to the
appropriate Ministry in the Central Government, the IRDA, the public and private sector
insurance companies, consumer organizations and a wide range of other experts in the
field of law and insurance. A copy of this Consultation Paper is also appended to this
Report as Appendix I. A large number of written responses were received to the
Consultation Paper. Discussions were also held with insurance companies, actuaries etc.
under the aegis of the FICCI. After going through oral and written responses to the
Consultation Paper, the Commission has prepared this Report.
