This product contained evidence of the presence of filth.

On July 16, 1988, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Mor-
ida, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the district court
an information against Howard W. Shaw and John R. Shaw, trading as the
Gulf Coast Fisheries at Jacksonville, Fla., alleging shipment by said defendants
in violation of the Food and Drugs Act within the period from on or about
February 12, 1938, to on or about February 15, 1938, from the State of Florida
into the States of New York and Pennsylvania of quantities of crab meat which
was adulterated.

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it consisted wholly or in
part of a filthy animal substance.

On October 3, 1938, the defendants filed a demurrer to the information, motion
for bill of particulars, and motion to quash, On October 14, 1938, the court
denied the motion to quash and overrule the demurrer, and granted the de-
fendants’ motion for bill of particulars as to the nature of the filthy animal
substance alleged to be the gist of the offense charged. On October 26, Howard
W. Shaw withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of nolo contendere
and on the same day, on motion of the United States attorney, the information
was dismissed as to John R. Shaw. Imposition of sentence was suspended as
to Howard W. Shaw and he was placed on probation for 5 years.

29802, Adulteration of earaway seed_ U. S. v. 110 Bags of Caraway Seed.
Default decree of condemnation and destruction. (F, & D,. No, 48109,

Sample No. 27662-D.)

This product, which had been shipped in interstate commerce and remained
unsold and in the original packages at the time of examination, was found
to contain materially less volatile oil than normal seed should contain, indi-
cating that the seed was partially exhausted.

On July 21, 1938, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of
Missouri, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 110 bags of caraway
seed at St. Louis, Mo.; alleging that the article had been shipped on or about
June 24, 1938, by P. H. Petry from New York, N. ¥.; and charging adulteration
in violation of the Food and Drugs Act.

Adulteration was alleged in that caraway seed from which a portion of the
yolatile oil had been removed had been mixed and packed with the article so
as to reduce, lower, or injuriously affect its quality or strength, and had been
substituted wholly or in part for it; and in that a valuable constituent, volatile
oil, had been wholly or in part abstracted.

On October 10, 1938, no claimant having appeared, judgment of condemnation
was entered and the product was ordered destroyed,

Harry L. Brown. Acting Secretary of Agriculture.
