On July 19, 1932, the date on which the verdict was returned in the district
court for the District of Maryland, finding certain shipments of B. & M.
misbranded because of false and fraudulent curative and therapeutic claims
in the labeling, there were pending in the Federal courts for the Districts of
Western New York, Northern Illinois, Eastern Michigan, Western Pennsylvania,
Eastern Virginia, and Southern New York, nine seizure actions in which libels
had been filed between the dates of September 4, 1931, and September 25, 1931,
against approximately 506 bottles of B. & M., in various lots at Buffalo, N.Y.,
Chicago, Ill, Detroit, Mich., Pittsburgh, Pa., Richmond, Va., and New York,
N.Y. The libels alleged that the article had been shipped in interstate com-
merce; that all shipments but one had been made by the F. BH. Rollins Co.,
from Boston, Mass., between the dates of August 4 and September 9, 1931, and
that the remaining shipment had been made by the Mutual Drug Co., from
Cleveland, Ohio, to Pittsburgh, Pa., on or about July 23, 1931; and charged
that the article was adulterated and misbranded in violation of the Food
and Drugs Act as amended. .

The libels alleged that the article was adulterated and misbranded in the
saline respects as the product involved in the case instituted in the District
of Maryland against certain quantities of B. & M. (Notice of Judgment No.
19651.)

The F. E. Rollins Co., Boston, Mass., appeared as claimant and filed answers
and exceptions to the above libels. On March 17, 1933, the libel filed in the
Southern District of New York was amended, the amended libel charging
misbranding of the article because of the false and fraudulent curative claims
appearing in the label; no answer or exceptions were filed to the amended libel.

Between the dates of July 17 and August 30, 1982 (and subsequent to the
verdict in the case tried in the District of Maryland), seizure proceedings
were instituted in the Federal district courts for Southern Florida, Northern
Alabama, Hastern Pennsylvania, Northern California, Oregon, Eastern Wiscon-
sin, Western Washington, Minnesota, Eastern Missouri, Southern Mississippi,
