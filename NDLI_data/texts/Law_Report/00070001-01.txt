LAW OF ARREST

1.1 Chapter five of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 deals with the arrest of persons.
Section 41 is the main section providing for situations when Police may arrest without
warrant. It reads as follows:

“41. When police may arrest without warrant.- (1) Any police officer may without

an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person-

la) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence, or against whom a

reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or

a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having been so concerned; or

2b) who has in his possession without lawful excuse, the burden of proving which

excuse shall lie on such person, any implement of house-breaking; or

3c) who has been proclaimed as an offender either under this Code or by order of

the State Government; or

4d) in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to

be stolen property and who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an

offence with reference to such thing; or

5e) who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has

escaped, or attempts to escape, from lawful custody; or

1f) who is reasonably suspected of being a deserter from any of the Armed Forces
of the Union; or

2g) who has been concerned in, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been
made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists,
of his having been concerned in, any act committed at any place out of India
which, if committed in India, would have been punishable as an offence, and for
which he is, under any law relating to extradition, or otherwise, liable to be
apprehended or detained in custody in India; or

3h) who, being a released convict, commits a breach of any rule made under sub-
section (5) of section 356; or

4i) for whose arrest any requisition, whether written or oral, has been received
from another police officer, provided that the requisition specified the person to
be arrested and the offence or other cause for which the arrest is to be made and it
appears therefrom that the person might lawfully be arrested without a warrant by
the officer who issued the requisition.

2. Any officer in charge of a police station may, in like manner, arrest or cause to be arrested any person,
belonging to one or more of the categories of persons specified in section 109 or section 110.”

1.2 Section 42 specifies yet another situation where a police officer can arrest a person.
According to this section if a person commits an offence in the presence of a police
officer or where he has been accused of committing a non-cognizable offence and refuses,
on demand being made by a police officer to give his name and residence or gives false
name or residence, such person may be arrested but such arrest shall be only for the
limited purpose of ascertaining his name and residence. After such ascertaining, he shall
be released on executing a bond with or without sureties, to appear before a magistrate if
