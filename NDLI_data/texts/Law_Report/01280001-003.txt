ADULTERATION OF MILK.

On or about May 2, 1910, Lawrence B. Jones, of Dickerson, Md.,
sold and delivered at the Union Station, Washington, D.C., a quantity
of milk. Dr. William C. Woodward, health officer of the District of
Columbia, acting by virtue of authority of the Secretary of Agri-
culture, caused a sample from the above delivery to be procured and
analyzed. As the findings of the analyst and report made indicated
that the milk was adulterated within the meaning of the Food and
Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, the said Lawrence B. Jones was afforded
an opportunity for hearing, and as it appeared after hearing held that
this sale was in violation of the act, the said health officer reported
the facts to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia.

In due course a criminal information was filed in the Police Court
of the District of Columbia, charging that the said milk was ‘adul-
terated, in that a substance, to wit, water, had been mixed and
packed with it so as to reduce and lower its quality.

On June 8, 1910, the defendant entered a plea of guilty, and the
court imposed a fine of $10.

This notice is given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs
Act of June 30, 1906.
