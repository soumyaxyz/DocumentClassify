15501. Misbranding of fleur. U. S, v. 240 Sacks of Crusader Flour, et al.
Decree of condemnation entered. Product released under bond.
-(F, & D, No. 22064. I. S. Nos. 16069-x to 16072-x, incl. S. No. 104.)

On or about September 22, 1927, the United States attorney for the Middle
District of Georgia, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed
in the District Court of the United States for said district a libel praying
seizure and condemnation of 330 sacks of flour, remaining in the original un-
broken packages at Athens, Ga., alleging that the article had been shipped by
the Sterling Mills, Inc., from Statesville, N. C., on or about August 31, 1927,
and transported from the State of North Carolina into the State of Georgia, and
charging misbranding in violation of the food and drugs act as ameuded. A
portion of the article was labeled in part: “Sterling Mills, Inc., Statesville,
N. C., Crusader Flour * * * 24 Lbs. Net. (or “48 Lbs. Net”).” The re-
mainder of the said article was labeled in part: “Sterling Mills, Inc., States-
ville, N. C., Instant Self-rising Flour * * 12 Lbs. Net (or “48 Lbs.
Net ”).”

Misbranding of the article was alleged in the libel for the reason that the
net weight statements, “48 Lbs. net,” “24 Lbs. net,” or “12 Lbs. net,” as the
case might be, were not correct. Misbranding was alleged for the further reason
that the article was in package form and the quantity of the contents was not
plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the package, since the
statements made were incorrect.

On November 19, 1927, the Sterling Mills, Inc., Statesville, N. C., having
appeared as claimant for the property and having admitted the allegations of
the libel, judgment of condemnation was entered, and it was ordered by the
court that the product be released to the said claimant upon payment of the
costs of the proceedings and the execution of a bond in the sum of $500, condi-
tioned in part that it not be sold or otherwise disposed of in violation of law.

ielaw are nay (Ogee Ce Pleas of guilty, Fine, $20. (F. & D.
No. 21575. I. S. Nos. 5842-x, 7580-x, 18764—x, 18765-x, 18767—x, 13840-x.)

On July 11, 1927, aie United States attorney for the District of Delaware,
acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District Court
of the United States for said district an information against Jacob K. Culver
and Norris Davis, members of a copartnership trading as the Delaware Bay
Oyster Co., Bowers, Del., alleging shipment by said defendants, in violation of
the food and drugs act, in various consignments, on or about October 14, 16, and
20, 1926, respectively, from the State of Delaware into the State of New York,
of quantities of oysters, which were adulterated.

It was alleged in the information that the article was adulterated in that a
substance, to wit, water, had been mixed and packed therewith so as to lower,
reduce, and injuriously affect its quality, and had been substituted in part for
oysters, which the said article purported to. be.

On November 7, 1927, the defendants entered pleas of guilty to the informa-
tion and-the court imposed a fine of $20.

W. M. Jarpine, Secretary of Agriculture.
