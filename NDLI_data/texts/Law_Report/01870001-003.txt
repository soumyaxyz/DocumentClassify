NOTICES OF JUDGMENT UNDER THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT

[Given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs Act]

12501. Adulteration of cottonseed cake, U. S. v. Cuero Cotton Oil & Mfz.
Co. a Corporation, Plea of guilty. Fine, $100. (F, & D. No. 15060.
I. S.J Nos, 12003-r, 12005-r.)

On January 16, 1922, the United States attorney for the Southern District
of Texas, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
District Court of the United States for said district an information against
the Cuero Cotton Oil & Manufacturing Co., a corporation, Cuero, Texas, alleg-
ing shipment by said company, in violation of the food and drugs act, in two
consignments, namely, on or about February 19 and March 18, 1919, respec-
tively, from the State of Texas into the State of Kansas, of quantities of cotton-
seed cake which was adulterated. The product consigned February 19, 1919,
was invoiced as “ 50.68% C. S. Cake,” namely, a product which contained 50.68

. per cent of protein. The product consigned March 18, 1919, was invoiced as
“©. S. Cake @ $62.05,” and was represented as containing not less than 48.05
per cent of protein.

Analyses of samples of the article by the Bureau of Chemistry of this de-
partment showed that the product consigned February 19, 1919, contained
48.25 per cent of protein and that the product consigned March 18, 1919, con-
tained 46.01 per cent of protein.

Adulteration of the article was alleged in the information for the reason
that a cottonseed cake of less than 50.68 per cent of protein, to wit, approx-
imately 48.25 per cent of protein, or a cottonseed cake of less than 48.05 per
cent of protein, to wit, 46.01 per cent of protein, as the case might be, had been
substituted for the said article.

On December 22, 1922, a plea of guilty to the information was entered on
behalf of the defendant company, and the court imposed a fine of $100.

Howarp M. Gorx, Secretary of Agriculture.

setts, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District
Court of the United States for said district a libel praying the seizure and
condemnation of 47 crates of butter, consigned July 8, 1924, remaining in the
original unbroken packages at Boston, Mass., alleging that the article had

stion and misbranding in violation of the food and drugs act as amended. The
