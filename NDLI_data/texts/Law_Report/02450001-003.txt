{Approved by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., December 80, 1936]

26001. Adulteration and misbranding of potatoes. Default entered. Product
Gee proceeds ordered forfeited. (F. & D. no. 87271. Sample no.

This case involved shipment of potatoes that fell below the grade indicated
on the label. ‘

On February 28, 1986, the United States attorney for the District of Massa-
chusetts, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 400 bags of potatoes
at Boston, Mass., alleging that the article had been shipped in interstate com-
merce on or about February 19, 1936, by National Fruit & Vegetable Exchange,
from Ashland, Maine, and charging adulteration and misbranding in violation
of the Food and Drugs Act as amended. The article was labeled in part:

“Maine Potatoes Grade U. S. No. 2, Packed by National Fruit & Vegetable
Exchange, Inc., Presque Isle, Maine.”

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that potatoes below U. 8.
grade No, 2 had been substituted in part for grade No. 2 potatoes.

The article was alleged to be misbranded in that the statement on the label,
“Grade U. S. No. 2”, was false and misleading and tended to deceive and mis-
lead the purchaser when applied to potatoes below U. S. grade No. 2.

Due notice having been given and no claimant having appeared, the court

ordered the product sold in view of the fact that it was perishable. On April ’
6, 1936, default was entered and the court ordered the proceeds of the sale
forfeited.

26002. Misbranding of vanilla extract. U. S. v. 264 Bottles and 240 Bottles of
Vanilla Extract. Consent decrees of condemnation and forfciture.
Product released under bend to be relabeled. (F. & D. nos. 37279, ;
7280. Sample nos. 53059-B, 53093-B,) q

These cases involved vanilla extract that was short in volume.

On March 8, 1986, the United States attorney for the Middle District of
Georgia, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court libels praying seizure and condemnation of 504 bottles of vanilla
extract at Fort Benning, Ga., consigned February 8, 1936, alleging that the
article had been shipped in interstate commerce by Schloss & Kahn Grocery
Co., from Chicago, Ill., charging misbranding in violation of the Food and
/Drugs Act. The article was labeled in part: (Carton) “$1 Size 8 Fluid
Ounces * * * Contents 8 fid. ozs.”; (bottle) “Cook’s Betty Smart * * *
Contents. 8 fid. ozs. Pure Vanilla Extract * * * Cook’s Food Products
Chicago.”

The article was alleged to be misbranded in that the statements on the
labels, (carton) “S Fluid Ounces” and “contents 8 fid. ozs.”, and (bottle)
“Contents § fid. ozs.”, were false and misleading and tended to deceive and
mislead the purchaser since the packages contained less than 8 fluid ounces.
The article was alleged further to be misbranded in that it was food in
package form and the quantity of contents was not plainly and conspicuously
marked on the outside of the package because the quantity stated was not
correct.
