part at Fort Smith, Ark., alleging that the article had been shipped by the
Aughinbaugh Canning Co., in part from Gulfport, Miss., and in part from
Biloxi, Miss.,.in various consignments, namely, February 27 and March 3, 1925,
respectively, and charging adulteration and misbranding in violation of the
food and drugs act as amended. The article was labeled in part: (Can)
“Nigger Head Brand Oysters Contains 5 Oz. Oyster Meat Distributed By
Aughinbaugh Canning Co. Of Baltimore City, Md.”

Adulteration of the article was alleged in substance in the libels for the
reason that excessive water or brine had been mixed and packed with the said
article so as to injuriously affect its quality and strength.

Misbranding was alleged for the reason that the statement on the labels to
the effect that the cans contained 5 ounces of oyster meat was false and
deceived and misled the purchaser, and for the further reason that the artide
was in package form and the quantity of the contents was not plainly marked
on the outside of the package.

On July 29, 1925, the Aughinbaugh Canning Co., Baltimore, Md., claimant,
having consented to the entry of decrees and to abide by the rulings of this de-
partment in reconditioning or relabeling the product, judgments of condemna-
tion were entered, and it was ordered by the court that the product be released
to the said claimant to be disposed of according to law, upon the execution of
good and sufficient bonds.
