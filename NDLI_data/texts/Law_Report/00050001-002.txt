This Committee was constituted by GOI Notification No. SO (3003)E, dated
December 23, 2012 to look into possible amendments of the Criminal Law to provide
for quicker trial and enhanced punishment for criminals committing sexual assault
of extreme nature against women. In view of the significance and urgency of the
task, the Committee undertook to perform it within 30 days, which task has been

completed.

Accordingly, the Committee has prepared its Report, which is enclosed

herewith.

It is the Committee's hope that the promptitude with which this Committee
was constituted within a few days of the brutal gang rape in Delhi on December 16,
2012, will continue to accomplish the task by speedy implementation of its
Recommendations to retain public confidence in good governance.

With Regards,

Hon'ble Dr. Manmohan Singh
Prime Minister of India
