Dear Sri Arun Jaitley ji,

I have great pleasure in forwarding the 186" Report of the Law Commission on ‘Proposal to
constitute Environment Courts’.

Pursuant to the observations of the Supreme Court of India in four judgments, namely, M.C. Mehta
vs. Union of India, 1986 (2) SCC 176; Indian Council for Environmental-Legal Action Vs Union of India:
1996(3)SCC 212; A.P. Pollution Control Board Vs M.V. Nayudu:1999(2)SCC 718 and_A.P. Pollution
Control Board Vs M.V. Nayudu II: 2001(2)SCC62, the Law Commission has undertaken a detailed study of
the subject of “Environmental Courts”. In the 3" of the above judgments, reference was made to the idea of
a “multi-faceted” Environmental Court with judicial and technical/scientific inputs as formulated by Lord
Woolf in England recently and to Environmental Court legislations as they exist in Australia, New Zealand
and other countries. Having regard to the complex issues of fact of science and technology which arise in
environmental litigation and in particular in the elimination of pollution in air and water, it is now
recognized in several countries that the Courts must not only consist of Judicial Members but must also
have a statutory panel of members comprising Technical or Scientific experts. We may in this context refer
to the recent Report of Dr. Malcolm Grant in UK(2000) and also to the Report of the Royal Commission
(23" Report , March 2002).

 

With Judicial and Technical inputs on the Bench, the Environmental Courts in Australia and New
Zealand function as appellate Courts against orders passed under the corresponding Water Acts, Air Acts
and Noise Acts and various Environment related Acts and also have original jurisdiction. They have all the
powers of a Civil Court. Some have even powers of a Criminal Court.

The Commission has, therefore, prepared a Report (copy enclosed) containing Chapters I to X
reviewing the Laws on “Environment Courts” in each State (or for group of States) and suggested in
Chapters IX and X that these Courts must be established to reduce the pressure and burden on the High
Courts and Supreme Court. These Courts will be Courts of fact and law, exercising all powers of a civil
court in its original jurisdiction. They will also have appellate judicial powers against orders passed by the
concerned authorities under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Air (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 with an enabling provision
that the Central Government may notify these Courts as appellate courts under other environment related
Acts as well. Such a law can be made under Art. 253 of the Constitution of India, read with Entry 13A of
List I of Schedule VII to give effect to decisions taken in Stockholm Conference of 1972 and Rio
Conference of 1992.

The proposed Environment Courts at the State level will, in the Commission’s view, be accessible
to citizens in each State.
