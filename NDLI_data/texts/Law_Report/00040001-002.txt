D.O.No.6(3)(39)/96-LC(LS)
, 18.3.1999

Dear Dr.M.Thambi Durai,

TI am forwarding herewith the 168th report on “The
Hire-Purchase Act, 1972",

2. The subject was taken up by the Commission in
pursuance of the reference of the Government of India
dated 30th September, 1996. Earlier, the Commission had
made an indepth study of the subject and forwarded its
20th report on “The Law of Hire-Purchase” in May, 1961.
Parliament enacted the Hire-Purchase Act, 1972 following
the recommendations of the Commission. A number of
companies carrying on hire-purchase business pointed out
certain deficiencies in the Act and therefore the said Act
could not be enforced. The Government of India
introduced the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, 1989 in
pursuance of the observations made by the Parliamentary
Standing Committee. Therefore, the Government of India
referred the whole issue of hire-purchase law to the Law
Commission for an indepth examination.

Be The need for a separate Hire-Purchase law to
regulate hire-purchase transactions, is undeniable. Such
a law is essential with a view to affording protection to
the buyer of the goods on hire-purchase, against certain

abuses in the practice of hire-purchase trading. Some
safeguards may also be required for the owner of the
goods.

4, The Commission circulated a questionnaire on “Law
of Hire-Purchase” to the concerned interest groups to
solicit their views on the subject. After considering
their views, the Commission has recommended various

amendments in the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, 1989 and
the Hire-Purchase Act, 1972. For the sake of convenience,
the Commission has alsa annexed The Hire-Purchase
(Amendment) Bi11, 1999 (Annexure-A to the report) which
incorporates the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Bill, 1989 and
our modifications therein as well as in the Principal Act.
Again, for the sake of convenience and ready reference, we
have set out in Annexure-B to the report, the

oreed
