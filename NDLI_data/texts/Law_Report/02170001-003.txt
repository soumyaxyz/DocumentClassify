NOTICES OF JUDGMENT UNDER THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT

[Given pursuant to section 4 of the food and drugs act]

20401-20550

[Approved by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., January 6, 1934]

20401. Adulieration of canned tomato catsup. U. S. v. 347 Cases of Tomato
Catsup. Default decree of condemnation, forfeiture, and destruc-
tien, (F. & D. no. 28255. I. S. no. 538688. S$. no. 6115.)

This action was based on the shipment of a quantity of canned tomato catsup,
samples of which were found to contain excessive mold.

On April 29, 1982, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the Dis-
trict Court of the United States for the district aforesaid a libel praying
seizure and condemnation of 847 cases of tomato catsup, remaining in the
original unbroken packages at Tyler, Tex., alleging that the article had been
shipped in interstate commerce, on or about November 24, 1931, by the Currie
Canning Co., from Grand Junction, Colo., to Tyler, Tex., and charging adultera-
tion in violation of the Food and Drugs Act. The article was labeled in part:
(Cans) “Colorado Columbine Brand Tomato Catsup Packed by the Currie
Canning Co., Grand Junction, Colorado.”

It was alleged in the libel that the article was adulterated in that it con-
sisted in part of a decomposed vegetable substance.

On October 14, 1982, no claimant having appeared for the property, judgment
of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, and it was ordered by the court
that the product be destroyed by the United States marshal.

R. G. Tuewett, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

20402. Misbranding of butter. U. S. vy. William Louis Korter (Idaho Dairy
Products Co.). Plea of guilty to count 2. Count 1 dismissed.
Fine, $100. (I, & D. no. 27465. I. §. no, 12522.)

This action was based on the interstate shipment of a quantity of butter
which was not properly labeled to indicate the quantity of the contents, since
samples taken from the shipment were found to contain less than 16 ounces,
the amount declared on the label.

On November 17, 1981, the United States attorney for the District of Idaho,
acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District Court
of the United States for the district aforesaid an information against William f
Louis Korter, trading as the Idaho Dairy Products Co., Moscow, Idaho, alleging
shipment by said defendant in violation of the Food and Drugs Act as amended,
on or about May 8, 1931, from the State of Idaho into the State of Washington.
of a quantity of butter that was misbranded. The article was labeled in part:
“Tdaho State Creamery Butter 16 Ounces Net When Packed * * * Moscow
Brand Made by The Moscow Creamery, Moscow, Idaho.”

It was alleged in count 1 of the information that the article was misbranded
in that the statement “16 Ounces Net”, borne on the packages, was false
and misleading, and for the further reason that the article was labeled as afore-
said so as to deceive and mislead the purchaser, since the packages did not
contain 16 ounces net, but did contain a less amount. Misbranding was al-
leged in count 2 of the information for the reason that the article was food
in package form and the quantity of the contents was not plainly and con-
spicuously marked on the outside of the package, since the statement made
was incorrect.
