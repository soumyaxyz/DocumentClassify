Dear Shri K. Jana Krishnamurthi ji,

I am forwarding herewith the 184" Report on the “Legal Education
& Professional Training and Proposals for Amendments to the Advocates
Act, 1961 and the University Grants Commission Act, 1956”.

The Commission took up the subject of ‘Legal Education’, suo motu,
as the said subject is fundamental to the very foundation of the Judicial
system. The Commission in the year 1999, issued a working paper
proposing certain amendments to the advocates Act, 1961. The scope of
the working paper was wide and it contained five chapters. Chapter I
thereof was Introductory, Chapter II related to ‘Legal Education and
Professional Training, Chapter III to ‘Professional Competence and Social
Responsibility’, Chapter IV to ‘entry of Foreign Legal Consultants and
Liberalization of Legal Practice, and Chapter V to ‘Management and
Development of the Profession’. However, in the present report, the
Commission has confined its recommendations to the ‘Legal Education and
Professional Training’ only.

The Bar Council of India (BCI), under Section 7 (1) (h) of the
Advocates Act, 1961, is empowered to promote legal education and lay
down ‘standards’ of such education in consultation with the Universities
imparting such education. The University Grants Commission, under
Section 2 (f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (UGC Act) is
also having power to exercise control over the Universities and affiliated
