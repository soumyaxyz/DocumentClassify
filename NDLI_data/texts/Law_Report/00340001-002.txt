Dear Shri Bharadwaj ji,

Perhaps, it is not an exaggeration to state that no other earlier reference to the Law
Commission in the last fifty years has been as important as the reference by the Hon’ble
Minister of Law and Justice dated 2’ November, 2005 asking the Commission to make a
study and give its suggestions on the proposed draft of the “Judges (Inquiry) Bill, 2005”
(hereinafter referred to as the Bill of 2005) prepared by the Law Ministry which deals with
procedures for removal of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. It is my
pleasure to forward this voluminous 195" Report on ‘Judges (Inquiry) Bill, 2005’ which, it

gives me some degree of satisfaction to say, was prepared in less than 90 days.

I may briefly explain, by way of a background to the present Report,
the procedure for removal of a Judge of the superior Courts under the Judges
(Inquiry) Act, 1968, the Motion and the judgments of the Supreme Court and
the procedure in the proposed draft Bill of 2005.
