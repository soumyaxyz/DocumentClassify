This product contained an excessive amount of fluorine.

On July 19, 1935, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Illinois, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the dis-
trict court a libel praying seizare and condemnation of 869 jars of dicalcium
phosphate at Chicago, Ill, alleging that it had been shipped in interstate com-
merce on or about May 21, 1935, by Parke, Davis & Co., from Detroit, Mich.,
and charging adulteration in violation of the Food and Drugs Act. The article
was labeled in part: “One Fourth Pound D © P 340 (Dicalcium Phosphate)
Parke, Davis & Co., Detroit, Mich.”

It was alleged to be adulterated in that it contained an added poisonous and
deleterious ingredient, to wit, fluorine, in an amount which might have rendered
it injurious to health.

On June 3, 1937, the answer and claim of Parke, Davis & Co., the sole in-
teryenor, having been withdrawn, judgment of condemnation was entered
and the product was ordered destroyed.

This case involved six shipments of canned shrimp five of which were
adulterated because of the presence of decomposed shrimp. The sixth lot was
misbranded because it fell below the standard of fill of container established
by this Department and was not labeled to indicate that it was substandard,
which was also true of one of the adulterated lots.

On September 5, 1936, the United States attorney for the Wastern District
of Texas, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of nine cases of canned
shrimp at Beaumont, Tex.

1937, libels were filed against 4 cases of canned shrimp at Beaumont, Tex., 17
cases of the product at Port Arthur, Tex., 180 cases at Chicago, Ill, and 6
cases at Peoria, Ill. The libels alleged that the article had been shipped in in-
terstate commerce between the dates of August 14, 1926, and February 24, 1937,
by the L. ©. Mays Co., Inc., from New Orleans, La.; and that certain lots were
adulterated, one lot was misbranded. and one lot was adulterated and mis-
branded in violation of the Food and Drugs Act as amended. A portion of the
article was labeled, “Doll Baby Brand Dry P.: Shrimp * * * L. C. Mays
Co., Inc., Distributors New Orleans, La.’”; anot portion was labeled, “White
Oak Brand Small Wet Shrimp Packed for Oakford And Fahnestock, Peoria,
til.” The remainder at the time of shipment was labeled, “Doll Baby Brand,”
but this label later was removed by the consignee.

The article in all lots with one exception was alleged to be adulterated in
that it consisted in whole or in part of a decomposed animal substance.
