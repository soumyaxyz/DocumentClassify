On October 28, 1915, the United States attorney for the District of Massa-
chusetts, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
District Court of the United States for said district a libel of information
for the seizure and condemnation of 15 cases and 5 cans of oysters, remain-
ing unsold in the original unbroken packages at Worcester, Mass., alleging
that the article had been shipped by the American Oyster Co., Providence,
hk. L, and transported from the State of Rhode Island into the State of
Massachusetts, and charging adulteration in violation of the Feod and Drugs
Act.

Adulteration of the article was alleged in the libel of information for the
reason that it consisted in part of a filthy, putrid, and decomposed animal
substance.

On November 23, 1915, no claimant having appeared for the property, judg-
ment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, and it was ordered by the
court that the product should be destroyed by the United States murshal.
