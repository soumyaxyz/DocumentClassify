16526. Misbranding of Nuremedy. U.S. v.12 Dozen Packages of Nuremedy.
Default decree of condemnation, forfeiture, and destruction. (F.
& D. No. 23526. I. S. No. 01548. 8S. No. 1507.)

On March 19, 1929, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of
Missouri, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
District Court of the United States for said district a libel praying seizure and
condemnation of 12 dozen packages of Nuremedy, remaining in the original
packages at St. Louis, Mo., alleging that the article had been shipped by the
Central Laboratories (1n¢.), from Mount Vernon, Ill, on or about January 3,
1929, and transported from the State of Illinois into the State of Missouri, and
charging misbranding in violation of the food and drugs act as amended.

Analysis of a sample of the article by this department showed that the tablets
contained 1.4 grains of acetphenetidin and 2.42 grains of acetylsalicylic acid
per tablet.

It was alleged in the libel that the article was misbranded in that the state-
ment on the carton label, “ Guaranteed to contain no Acetanilid,”’ and in the
circular, ““ Nuremedy contains no Acetanilid,” were false and misleading in that
the said statenients imported and signified to the purchaser that the article con-
tained no ingredient or combination of ingredients with the effect of acetani-
lide, whereas it contained acetphenetidin, a derivative of acetanilide, which
has the same effect as acetanilide. Misbranding was alleged for the further
reason that the statements “Does not disturb the stomach” and “ Does not
Affect The Heart,” appearing in the circular, were false and misleading, and
for the further reason that the packages failed to bear a plain and legible
statement on the label of the quantity of acetphenetidin, a derivative of ace-
tanilide, contained therein, since the declaration was inconspicuous, was partly
obscured by overprinting, and did not include a statement to the effect that
acetphenetidin is a derivative of acetanilide. Misbranding was alleged for the
further reason that the following statements regarding the curative and
therapeutic effects of the article, (carton, front panel) “ Recommended for

* * Neuralgia, Rheumatism * * * La Grippe,”’ (carton, back per

“Neuralgia * * * Rheumatism and Gout * * * La Grippe * *
