consideration of the various responses and views, recommends for
providing a statutory right of appeal against the judgment of the High Court
confirming or awarding the death sentence. Accordingly, the Commission
has recommended that the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal
Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 be suitably amended for providing right to appeal to
the Supreme Court.

Yet another aspect is important vis-a-vis the armed forces. As of
now, there is no provision of right of appeal against the sentence of death
passed by Court Martial under the Army Act, 1950, the Navy Act, 1957 and
the Air Force Act, 1950. The Commission has, after considering the
responses and views, recommended that there should be an appeal to the
Supreme Court against the order of death sentence passed by Court Martial
mentioned above. It is also recommended that one of the present mode of
execution of death sentence in the statutes above referred to i.e. ‘hanging by
neck’, should be replaced by ‘administering lethal injection until accused is
dead’. There should be a further provision that lethal injection should be an
alternative mode of execution of death sentence passed by Court Martial.
The Commission has therefore recommended that suitable amendments in
these Acts may be made for these purposes.

Finally, the Commission also recommends that death sentence matters
should be heard by a five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court. It also
recommends that the Supreme Court Rules may be suitably amended to
bring into effect these objectives.

With regards,
Yours sincerely,
