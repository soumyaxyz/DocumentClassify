17, 1912, from the State of New York into the State of Pennsylvania, of a
quantity of oysters which were adulterated.

department showed the following results: Five out of 5 oysters showed the
presence of gas-producing organisms in bile fermentation tubes after 3 days’
incubation at 87° C. in 1 cc quantities; 5 out of 5 oysters in 0.1 ce quantities;
4 out of 5 oysters in 0.01 ce quantities; 0 out of 5 oysters in 0.001 cc quantities;

410 points.

Adulteration of the product was charged in the indictment for the reason

indictment, and the court suspended sentence.
