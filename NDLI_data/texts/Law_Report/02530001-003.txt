25801, Misbranding of ammonia water. U. S. vy. Wilbur E. Crofton (Kight’s
Drug Store). Plea of guilty. Fine, $10, (F. & D. no. 33911. Sample
no. 62477-A.)

This case involved ammonia water that was approximately 40 percent below
the minimum strength required by the United States Pharmacopoeia.

On May 15, 1935, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia,
acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the Supreme Court
of the District an information against Wilbur E. Crofton, trading as Kight’s
Drug Store, Washington, D. C., charging sale in the District of Columbia by
said defendant in violation of the Food and Drugs Act, on or about May 10, 1934,
of a quantity of ammonia water that was misbranded. The article was labeled
in part: “Stronger Ammonia Water Poison * * * Sold by Kight’s Drug
Stores * * *, Washington, D. ©.”

‘he article was alleged to be misbranded in that it was sold under a name
recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia and differed from the standard
of strength, quality, and purity as determined by the test laid down in said
pharmacopoeia, and its own standard was not stated on the label.

The information also charged a violation of the Federal Caustic Poison Act,
reported in notice of judgment no. 50 published under that act. On May 15,
1935, the defendant entered a plea of guilty, and the court imposed a fine of $10
for violation of both acts.

Illinois, acting: upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court an information against Bhrhart & Karl, Inc., a corporation,
Chicago, Ill., alleging shipment in violation of the Food and Drugs Act, as

quantity of Sulfo-Kresol-Tabs which were misbranded. The article was labeled

ea) * Chicago, Hl.”

Analysis showed that the tablets contained oxyquinoline sulphate (slightly
more than one-fourth grain per tablet) and lactose; no free sulphur and na
eresol were found.

Misbranding of the article was charged (a) under the allegations that there
were borne on the label attached to the bottle the statements, to wit, “Sulfo-
Kresol-Tabs (Cs-He-N. SO.)”; that the said statement represented that the
article contained sulphur and cresol and the formula indicated a preparation
containing no oxyquinoline sulphate; that the article contained no sulphur nor
cresol, and did contain oxyquinoline sulphate; that the aforesaid statements
