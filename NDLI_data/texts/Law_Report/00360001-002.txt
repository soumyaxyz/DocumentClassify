Dear Shri Bhardwaj Ji,

Sub: Report No.199 of the Law Commission on ‘Unfair (Procedural

and Substantive) Terms in Contracts’.

The subject of ‘Unfair Terms In Contract’ has attained grave
importance in recent times not only in relation to consumer contracts but
also in regard to other contracts. In 1984, the 103 Report of the Law
Commission was submitted and it was suggested that a single section (sec.
67A) be incorporated in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 with two subsections

countries and detailed statutes have been enacted or proposed and there are
voluminous Reports of the Law Commissions such as the Report of the Law
Commission of England and Scotland (2004), the Report of the South
African Law Commission, 1998, the Interim Report of the British Columbia
Law Institute, 2005, the Discussion Paper of the Standing Committee of
