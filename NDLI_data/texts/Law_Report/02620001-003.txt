MISBRANDING OF SYRUP.

On January 27, 1913, the United States Attorney for the District
of Connecticut, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture,
filed in the District Court of the United States for said district a
libel for the seizure and condemnation of 12 cases of syrup, remaining
unsold in the original unbroken packages and in possession of Salt-
man Bros., Bridgeport, Conn., alleging that the product had been
shipped on or about December 19, 1912, by Goulding Bros., Whitman,
Mass., and transported from the State of Massachusetts into the
State of Connecticut, and charging misbranding in violation of the
Food and Drugs Act. The product was labeled: (On cases) “2 doz.
10¢ Size Appetone Brand—Trade Mark—Fancy Syrup—Put up by
Goulding Bros., Whitman, Mass.” (On bottles) “75% Cane Sugar
25% Maple. Appetone Brand Blended Fancy Syrup—Made from
Cane and Maple Sugar—Prepared by Goulding Bros., Whitman,
Mass.” :

Misbranding was alleged in the libel for the reason that the prod-
uct was labeled “75% Cane Sugar 25% Maple” and “Appetone
Brand Blended Fancy Syrup-—Made from Cane and Maple Sugar—
Prepared by Goulding Bros., Whitman, Mass.”, when. as a matter
of fact, the syrup did not contain 25 per cent of maple syrup, but
less than 5 per cent of maple syrup.

On March 14, 1913, no claimant having appeared for the property.
judgment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered and it was
ordered by the court that the product should be sold or destroyed by
the United States marshal.
