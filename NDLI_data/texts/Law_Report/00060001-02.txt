D.O.No.6(3)(79) /2002-LC(LS) 8.11.2002
Dear Shri Janakrishnamurthy Ji,

I am sending herewith the 183" report on “A continuum on the General
Clauses Act, 1897 with special reference to the admissibility and codification of
external aids to interpretation of statutes”.

2: The subject was taken up in pursuance to reference dated 28.1.2002
from the Legislative Department, Ministry of Law, Justice & Co. Affairs,
Government of India for examining the Commission’s 60 Report on the
General Clauses Act, 1897 submitted to the Government of India in the year,
1974. The reference specifically seeks the Commission’s views on the issue
whether extrinsic aids should be made admissible in construction or
interpretation of a statute, and if so, whether rules for extrinsic aids should be
codified and incorporated in the General Clauses Act, 1897? Further, it was
stated in the reference that there has been conflict in judicial decisions as to
the admissibility of extrinsic aids and our courts are not following uniform
approach to principles of statutory constructions especially regarding tools
relating to external aids. Another question was also posed in the reference that
since 1974 when the 60 Report of the Commission was submitted, many new
statutes have come into force and some of the canons of interpretation on the
use of extrinsic aid have also undergone changes, would it not lead to a
‘criticism that the said report has lost its relevance because of a long gap’. The
Commission has examined the following main issues arising out of the said
reference:

A) Whether the General Clauses Act, 1897 should also provide the
principles of interpretation of a statute as regards the extrinsic
aids of interpretation and;

B) Whether recommendations made in the said 60 Report need any
revision or whether those have lost relevance now.

The Commission has given its considered recommendations on these

issues in this report.

With regards,
