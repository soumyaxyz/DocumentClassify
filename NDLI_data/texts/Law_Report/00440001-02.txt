Dear Shri Bharadwaj Ji,

Sub: 197" Report of the Law Commission on ‘Public Prosecutor’s

Appointments.

I have great pleasure in forwarding the 197" Report of the Law Commission on
‘Public Prosecutor’s Appointments’.

The Ministry of Home Affairs, in their file bearing No.12/33/2006-Judicial Cell
forwarded to the Law Commission of India on 29.5.2006 a letter of the Prime Minister’s
Office ID No.805/11/C/4/06-Pol dated 16.5.2006, seeking the views of the Law
Commission on three matters which read as follows:

“(i

(ii)
(iii)

Making of appointment of Public Prosecutors/ Additional Public Prosecutors
only from amongst persons constituting regular Cadre of Prosecuting Officers
— in terms of s. 24(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908 (sic 1973), as
originally legislated by Parliament- may need to be legislatively restored to
override various State Amendments. Further, a time limit may need to be
prescribed by law to require creation of such cadres in a definite timeframe,
while simultaneously incorporating a ‘sunset clause’ in s. 24(4) of the Cr.P.C.
Requirement of consultation with Sessions Judge u/s. 24(4) may need be
resorted to override State Amendment(s).

Other institutional mechanism(s) and safeguard(s) in terms of eligibility
requirement, assessment of past performance, adequate tenure, etc. could be
considered to reduce the scope for arbitrariness in appointments.”

In this 197" Report, the Law Commission has made indepth study of the role of the
Police, the Prosecutor, the Executive and the Courts in the criminal justice process and
