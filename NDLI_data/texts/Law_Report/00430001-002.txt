Dear Sh. Bhardwaj Ji,

Sub: 198" Report of the Law Commission on ‘Witness Identity
Protection and Witness Protection Programme”.

The Supreme Court of India has recently referred to the questions of
‘Witness Identity Protection’ and ‘Witness Protection Programmes’ in a
number of judgments: NHRC v. State of Gujarat: 2003 (9) SCALE 329,
PUCL v. Union of India: 2003(10) SCALE 967, Zahira v. State of Gujarat:
2004(4) SCC 158, Sakshi v.Union of India:2004 (6) SCALE 15 and Zahira v.
Gujarat 2006 (3) SCALE 104. In_Sakshi the Court emphasized the need
for legislation on witness protection. In view of these observations, the Law
Commission has taken up the subject suo motu. In this Report it has confined
the Witness Identity Protection procedures to cases triable by the Court of
Session of Courts of equal rank.

 

Witness Identity Protection may require during investigation, inquiry
and trial while Witness Protection Programmes apply to the physical
protection of the witness outside the Court.

It is accepted today that Witness Identity Protection is necessary in the
case of all serious offences wherein there is danger to witnesses and it is not
confined to cases of terrorism or sexual offences.

Initially, the Law Commission prepared a Consultation Paper on
“Witness Identity Protection and Witness Protection Progammes’ (August
2004) and invited responses to the Questionnaire.

The Consultation Paper contained three parts: Part I — General
(Chapter 1 to IV), Part II — Witness Identity Protection v. Rights of accused
(Chapters V, VI) and Part III — Witness Protection Programmes (Chapter VII).
