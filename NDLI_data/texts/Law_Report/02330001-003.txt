22576. Misbranding of Vapex. U. S. ¥. 10 Dozen Packages, et al., of Vapex

These cases involved several shipments of Vapex, a drug preparation. One
Jot, the earliest shipment, bore no declaration of the alcohol content. Later
shipments bore no declaration of alcohol on the carton and only an inconspic-
uous statement on the reverse of the bottle label. The labels of these later ship-
ments were further objectionable since they contained false and misleading
claims as to its effectiveness as a bactericide and as to the place of manu-
facture,

On June 18, 1930, the United States attorney for the Southern District of
Iowa, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the district
court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 10 dozen packages of Vapex
at Des Moines, Iowa. Between the dates of December 12, 1932, and January
10, 1933, libels were filed in various United States district courts against 45
dozen bottles of the product at St. Louis, Mo., 195 dozen bottles at Pittsburgh,
Pa., 100 gross bottles at San Francisco, Calif., 11 dozen bottles at Kansas City,
Mo., 7 gross bottles at Philadelphia, Pa., and 11 dozen bottles at Trenton, N. J.
The libels charged that the article had been shipped in interstate commerce by
H. Fougera, & Co., Inc., from New York, N. Y.; that the product located at
Des Moines, Iowa, had been shipped on or about May 9, 1930 and the remaining
lots between the dates of October 15 and December 14, 1932; and that the
-article was misbranded in violation of the Food and Drugs Act.

Analysis of a sample of the article by this Department showed that it con-
sisted of an alcoholic solution of oil of lavender, oil of eucalyptus, and menthol
containing 63.5 percent by volume of ethyl alcohol. Samples from other ship-
ments were found upon analysis to Consist essentially of volatile oils, such
as menthol and lavender oil, alcohol (approximately 66 percent by volume),
and water.

The libel filed in the Southern District of Iowa charged that the article was
misbranded in that it contained alcohol and the quantity or proportion of the
said alcohol was not stated on the label. The remaining libels charged that
the article was misbranded in that the statements in the circular, “ Vapex
is produced in England by Thos. Kerfoot & Co. Ltd. * * * Laboratory
‘Tests have proved that the Vapex vapor kills the pathogenic bacteria present
in the breathing passages ”, and on the carton, “ Vapex is a product of Thos.
Kerfoot & Co., Ltd. Bardsley, England”, were false and misleading; and for
the further reason that the package failed to bear a statement of the quantity
or proportion of alcohol contained in the article, since the carton bore no
declaration whatever of alcohol and the bottle label carried only an incon-
-spicuous declaration of alcoho] on the reverse side of the bottle.
