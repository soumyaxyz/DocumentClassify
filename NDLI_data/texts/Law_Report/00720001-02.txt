Dear Hon’ble Minister Dr. M. Veerappa Moily,

Sub: Conversion/reconversion to another religion —
mode of proof

I am forwarding herewith the 235" Report of the Law Commission of India
on the above subject.

In a matrimonial appeal disposed of by the Kerala High Court, the question
was whether the wife who applied for divorce with mutual consent under Section
13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 satisfactorily proved the factum of
conversion to Hindu religion. /nter alia, the Family Court held that the applicant-
wife who was Christian by birth has not established that she had converted herself
to Hindu religion and there was no adequate proof of valid solemnization of
marriage as per Hindu customs and rites.

The High Court set aside the said findings and directed de novo
consideration of the issue after giving further opportunity to the applicant to
adduce appropriate evidence. The observations made in paragraph 15 of the
judgment are extracted in the opening paragraph of the enclosed Report. In
paragraph 16 of the judgment, the Registry was directed to forward a copy of the
Judgment to the Law Commission of India, drawing the attention of the
Commission to paragraph 15.
