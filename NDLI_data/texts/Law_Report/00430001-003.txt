1. Witness Identity Protection:

We shall briefly refer to our approach on Witness Identity Protection in
Part I of the Final Report.

The accused in our country have a right to an open public trial in a
criminal court and also a right to examination of witnesses in open court in
their presence. But, these rights of the accused are not absolute and may be
restricted to a reasonable extent in the interests of fair administration of
justice and for ensuring that victims and witnesses depose without any fear.
