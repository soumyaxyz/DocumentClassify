Bengal Money-Lenders Act (X of 1940), s. 36—~Private sale by
judgment debtor to decree-holder in part satisfaction of decree debi—
Application for relief under s. 86—Whether Court can set aside sale
and restore possession of properties—Scope of the Act.

In exercising its powers under s. 36 of the Bengal Money-
Lenders Act for giving relief to a borrower, the Court cannot set
aside a voluntary sale made by a judgment debtor to the decree-
holder in part satisfaction of the decree debt and restore posses-
sion of the properties sold, to the judgment debtor. The only
provision in s. 36 relating to restoration of properties is sub-s. (2)
of that section, and a voluntary sale by the debtor does not come
within the purview of that sub-section,

What the Bengal Money-Lenders Act aims at is not to wipe
out all transactions between the lender and the borrower and the

rights flowing from them, but to re-open those transactions only

which are necessary for adjusting and moulding the rights of the
parties in accordance with the provisions of the Act and to substi-
tute s statutory mode of accounting in place of that based on
oqntract between the parties.
