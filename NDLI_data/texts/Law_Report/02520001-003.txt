26801. Misbranding of candy. U.S. v. Peoples Drug Stores, Inc. Plea ef nolo
contendere. Fine, $10. (i. & D. no. 34071. Sample nos, 4616-B, 4617-B,
4626-B, 4627-B.)

This case involved candy that was short in weight.

On September 11 1935, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia,
acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture filed in the police court
an information against Peoples Drug Stores, Inc., Washington, D. C., alleging
that on or about July 5 and July 9, 1934, the defendant had sold in the
District of Columbia quantities of candy that was misbranded in violation of the
Food and Drugs Act as amended. ‘The article was labeled in part: “Delicious
Candies Always Fresh and Pure * * * Peoples Drug Stores And Affiliated
Corporations * * * [inconspicuously printed on side panel] 1 Lb. Net.”

The article was alleged to be misbranded in that the statement “1 Lb. Net”,
borne on the box, was false and misleading and tended to deceive and mis-
lead the purchaser since the net weight of the article was not 1 pound but
was less; and in that it was food in package form and the quantity of the
contents was not plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the
package.

On September 11, 1985, a plea of nolo contendere was entered on behalf of
the defendant and the court imposed a fine of $10.

M. L, Witson, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

This case involved an interstate shipment of cheese that contained filth.

On June 28, 1935, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Illinois, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the dis-
trict court a libel praying seizure and condemnation of 405 boxes of cheese
at Chicago, Ill, alleging that the article had been shipped in interstate com-
merce in various shipments between the dates of March 27 and April 18, 1935,
by the Northroad Cheese Factory from Watertown, Wis., and charging adultera-
tion in violation of the Food and Drugs Act.

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it consisted wholly or in
part of a filthy animal substance.

On March 2, 1936, no claimant having appeared, judgment of condemna-
tion was entered and it was ordered that the product be destroyed.
