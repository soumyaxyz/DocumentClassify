Dear Shri Bhardwaj Ji,

Sub: 201“ Report on “Medical Treatment after Accidents and During
Emergency Medical Condition and Women in Labour”.

The Supreme Court of India as long back as 1989 observed in
Parmanand Katara v. Union of India AIR 1989 SC 2039 that when accidents
occur and the victims are taken to hospitals or to a medical practitioner, they
are not taken care of for giving emergency medical treatment on the ground
that the case is a medico-legal case and the injured person should go to a
Government Hospital. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for
making it obligatory for hospitals and medical practitioners to provide
emergency medical care. This is not the only reason for not attending on
injured persons or persons in a medical emergency, for sometimes such
persons are turned out on the ground that they are not in a position to make
payment immediately or that they have no insurance or that they are not
members of any scheme which entitles them to medical reimbursement.
The Supreme Court reiterated its views in Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor
Samithi v. State of West Bengal, 1996 (4) SCC 37 and National Consumer
Redressal Commission has also decided in like manner in Pravat Kumar
Mukerjee v. Ruby General Hospital (25.4.2005). The Law Commission
has, therefore, taken up the subject suo motu in view of the observations of
the Supreme Court in Parmanand Katara.
