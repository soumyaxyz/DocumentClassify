MISBRANDING OF COFFEE.

On May 20, 1912, the United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, acting upon a report by the Secretary of
Agriculture, filed in the District Court of the United States for said
district a libel for the seizure and condemnation of 3 sacks, each
containing approximately 100 pounds of so-called compound roasted
coffee, remaining unsold in the original unbroken packages and in
possession of the Merchants & Miners Transportation Co., Philadel-
phia, Pa., alleging that the product had been shipped on or about
May 11, 1912, from the State of New York into the Stat» of Penn-
sylvania and charging misbranding in violation of the Food and
Drugs Act. The product was labeled: ‘‘Austin Nichols & Co., 100
lbs ground compound X roasted coffee, New York.”

Misbranding was alleged in the libel for the reason that the sacks
containing the product bore a statement regarding it which was false
and misleading in that the sacks bore the label set forth above wherein
and whereby the product was represented to be ground compound
roasted coffee, whereas in truth and in fact it was not so, but was a
mixture containing not more than 50 per cent of ground coffee, the
remaining portion of said mixture consisting of chicory, cereals,
legumes, and other materials other than coffee.

On June 14, 1912, Austin Nichols & Co., New York, N. Y., claim-
ants, having consented to a decree, judgment of condemnation and
forfeiture was entered and it was further ordered that upon payment
of all costs of the proceedings and the execution and delivery by said
claimants of bond in the sum of $300, in conformity with section 10
of the Act, the product should be released and delivered to the

claimants.
