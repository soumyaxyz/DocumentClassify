On December 27, 1917, the United States attorney for the Western Distr
of New York, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in
District Court of the United States for said district a Mbel for the seizure
and condemnation of 5,296 cans, each containing 5 gallons of tomato pulp,
remaining unsold in the original unbroken packages at Buffalo, N. Y., alleging
that the article had been shipped on or about November 14, 1917, by the
Deblieux & Mays Co., Owensboro, Ky., and was being transported from the
State of Kentucky into the Dominion of Canada, and charging adulteration in
violation of the Food and Drugs Act,

Adulteration of the article was alleged in substance in the libel for the
reason that it consisted in part of a filthy, decomposed, and moldy vegetabie
substance and was unfit for food,

On February 1, 1918, William Davies & Co., Ltd., Toronto, Canada, claim-
ant, having filed an answer denying that the goods were decayed and unfit for
use as charged in the libel, and the case having come on to be heard, judgment
of condemnation and forfeiture was entered, and it was ordered by the
court that the product should be destroyed by the United States marshal, and
that judgment be entered against the claimant for the costs of the proceedings,

G, I. Curistie, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.
