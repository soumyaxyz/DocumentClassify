NOTICE OF JUDGMENT NO. 1001.

(Given pursuant to section 4 of the Food and Drugs Act.)

 

ADULTERATION OF TOMATO PASTE.

On December 8, 1910, the United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, acting upon the report of the Secretary of
Acriculture, filed in the District Court of the United States for said
district a libel praying condemnation and forfeiture of 35 boxes of
tomato paste in the possession of H. Polinsky.

Examination of the two samples from said consignment by the
Bureau of Chemistry of the United States Department of Agricul-
ture showed them to contain, respectively, yeasts and spores 600 per
one-sixtieth emm., and 250,000,000 bacteria per ce., and mold filaments
in 55 per cent of fields; yeasts and spores 500 per one-sixtieth cmm.,
and 250,000,000 bacteria per cc., and mold filaments in 55 per cent of
fields. The libel alleged that the tomato paste, after transportation
from New York into Pennsylvania, remained in the original un-

broken packages, and was adulterated in violation of the Food and ©

Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, because jt consisted in whole or in part
of a filthy, putrid, or decomposed vegetable substance, and was
therefore liable to seizure for confiscation.

On December 22, 1910, H. Polinsky filed answer to said libel, a
jury was waived, and the case was heard by the court. On March 14,
1911, the court found the said product to consist in part of a decom-
posed vegetable substance, and that the United States was entitled
to a decree of condemnation as prayed for in the libel. Accordingly
a decree was entered on March 31, 1911, condemning and forfeiting
the goods to the United States and ordering their destruction by the
marshal.
