interim order for the grant of anticipatory bail in
the first instance;

(ii1) where the Court has rejected the application or
has not passed any interim order, it will be open
to the officer-in-charge of a Police Station to
arrest the applicant, without warrant, on the basis
of the accusation apprehended in the application
for the grant of anticipatory bail;

(iv) where the Court makes an interim order for the
grant of interim bail, it will forthwith give a
notice being not less than seven daysâ€™ notice to
the Public Prosecutor and the Superintendent of
the Police with a view to give them an
opportunity of being heard when the application
is finally heard;

(v) _ the presence of the applicant seeking anticipatory
bail will be obligatory at the time of final hearing
of the application if the Court considers such
presence necessary in the interest of justice on an
application made by the Public Prosecutor for
such presence.

The principal objection against the new provisions
has been the personal presence of the applicant at the time of
final hearing of the application. The main apprehension has been
that the applicant could be arrested in the event of rejection of his
application and the applicant would thus be deprived of his right
to move the higher court for necessary relief.

In this 203" Report, the Law Commission has made
an in-depth study of the scope and ambit of the existing as well
as the amended Section with reference to the case law on the
subject before making its recommendations. A draft text for
revising the Section is also given in the concluding Chapter of
the Report.
