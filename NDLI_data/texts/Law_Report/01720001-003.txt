6851. Adulteration of gelatin. U. 8S. * * * wv. 15 Barrels of Gelatin,
Consent decree of condennation and forfeiture. Product ordered
released on bond. (F. & D. No. 8400. 1. S. No. 10871-m. 8, No. C-723,)

 

On July 31, 1917, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Ohio, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District
Court of the United States for said district a libel for the seizure and con-
demnation of 15 barrels of gelatin, remaining. unsold in the original unbroken
packages at Cleveland, Ohio, alleging that the article had been shipped on or
about February 12, 1917, by T. M. Duche & Sons, Chicago, II, and transported
from the State of Illinois into the State of Ohio, and charging adulteration in
violation of the Food and Drugs Act. The article was invoiced as “ Edible
Gelatine,”

Adulteration of the article was alleged in the libel for the reason that glue,
containing an excessive amount of zinc, had been mixed and packed with it,
so as to reduce, lower, and injuriously affect its quality and strength, and had
been substituted for pure food gelatin, which the article purported to be,
and for the further reason that the product contained zinc, an added poisonous
and deleterious ingredient, which might render it injurious te health.

On August 15, 1917, Charles Townsend & Bro., New York, N. Y., claimants,
having admitted the allegations of the libel, judgment of condemnation and
forfeiture was entered, and it was ordered by the court that the product
should be released to said claimants upon payment of the costs of the proceed-
ings and the execution of a bond in the sum of $2,000, in conformity with section
10 of the act.
