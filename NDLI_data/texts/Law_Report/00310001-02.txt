DO No.6(3)/85/2003-LC(LS) 17" October, 2003

Dear Sri Arun Jaitley,

I have the pleasure of forwarding the 187° Report of the Law
Commission of India on ‘Mode of Execution of Death Sentence and
Incidental Matters’. The subject was taken up by the Commission suo motu.
At present, as per section 354(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,
the mode of execution of death sentence is ‘hanging till death’.

The Supreme Court in Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab (1982) 3
SCC 25, has observed that physical pain and suffering which the execution
of the sentence of death entails is also no less cruel and inhuman. The
Commission therefore undertook a study to provide a humane mode of
execution of death sentence. Accordingly, it circulated a Consultation
Paper on this issue. The Commission considered various modes of
execution of death sentence prevailing world wide. Many responses were
received to this Consultation Paper. A seminar was also organized on this
subject at New Delhi. On the basis of the various responses and also the
deliberations held at the seminar, the Commission has prepared this Report.

The Commission has recommended that sec. 354(5) of the Cr.P.C.,
1973 be amended by providing an alternative mode of execution of death
sentence by lethal injection until the accused is dead. It will be in the
discretion of the Judge to pass an appropriate order regarding the mode of
execution of death sentence. The convict shall, of course, be heard on the
question of mode of execution of death sentence before such discretion is
exercised.

Further, at present, there is no statutory right of appeal to the Supreme
Court in cases where High Court confirms the death sentence passed by a
Session Judge or where the High Court enhances the sentence passed by the
Session Judge and awards sentence of death. The Commission, on a
