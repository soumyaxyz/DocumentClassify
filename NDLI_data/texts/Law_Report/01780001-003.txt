9251, Misbranding of tenkage. U.S. * * * v. Swift & Co., a Corpora-
tion, Plea of nolo contendere. Fine, $100 and costs. (EB. & D. No.
11132. I. 8S. No. 10704-r.)

On December 13, 1919, the United States attorney for the Nerthern District
of Ohio, acting upor report by the Se ary of Agriculture, filed in the Dis-
trict Court of the United States for said district an information against Swift
& Co., a corporation, having a place of business at Cleveland, Ohio, alleging
shipment by said company, in violation of the Food and Drugs Act, on or about
February 1, 1919, frem the State of Ohio into the State of Indiana, of a
quantity of tankage which was misbranded. The article was iaheled in part:
“Swift & Company, of Chicago, Ill., Guarantee this Swift’s Dig Tankage
to contain not less than * * * 60.0 per cent. of crude protein * =

Analysis of a sample of the article by the Bureau of Chemistry of this de-
partment showed that it contained 55.6 per cent of crude protein.

Misbranding of the articie was alleged in the information for the reason that
the following statement appearing on the label, to wit, “* * ™ to contain
not less than * ™ * 60.0 per cent. of crude protein,” was false and mislead-
ing in that it represented that said article contained not 1 than 60 per cent
of crude protein, and for the further reason that the article was labeled as
aforesaid so as to deceive and mislead purchasers into the belief that it con-
tained not less than 60 per cent of crude protein, whereas, in truth and in fact,
it contained less than 60 per cent of crude protein.

On March 21, 1921, a plea of nolo contendere to the information was
entered on behalf of the defendant company, and the court imposed a fine of
$100 and costs.
