[Approved by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., May 15, 1935]

22301. Adulteration and misbranding of frozen_eges. U. vy. Marshall
Kirby Co. Plen of guilty. Fine, $50. (F, & D. no. 74g, NTS no.
028461.)

This case was based on an interstate shipment of frozen eggs, sample cans
of which were found to be putrid, sour, or musty. The cans failed to bear
a statement on,the label of the quantity of the contents.

On November 23, 1931, the United States attorney for the Southern District
of Indiana, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the
district court an information against the Marshall Kirby Co., a corporation,
Terre Haute, Ind., alleging shipment by said company in violation of the
Food and Drugs Act as amended, on or about June 19, 1930, from the State of
Indiana into the State of New Jersey, of a quantity of frozen eggs which were
adulterated and misbranded.

The article was alleged to be adulterated in that it consisted in whole and
in part of a filthy, decomposed, and putrid animal substance.

Misbranding was alleged for the reason that the article was food in package
form and the quantity of the contents was not plainly and conspicuously marked
on the outside of the package.

On November 14, 1934, a plea of guilty was entered on behalf of the defendant
company, and the court imposed a fine of $50.

M. L. Witson, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.

23302, Misbranding of canned black raspberries. U. S. v. Hunt Bros, Pack-
ing Co. Plea of guilty. Fine, $400. (I. & D, no, 32118, Sample no.
29837-A.)

Sample cans of black raspberries taken from the shipment involved in this
case were found to contain less than the declared weight.

On June 4, 1934, the United States attorney for the District of Oregon,
acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the district court
an information against the Hunt Br Packing Co., a corporation trading
at Salem, Oreg., alleging shipment by said company, in violation of the Food
and Drugs Act as amended, on or about January 24, 1938, from the State of
Oregon into the State of California, of a quantity of canned black raspberries
which were misbranded. The article was labeled in part: “ Famous Puyallup
Brand Solid Pack Black Raspberries Net Weight 6 Lbs. 8 Ozs. Packed by
Pacifie North West Canning Co., Puyallup, Wash.”

The article was alleged to be misbranded in that the statement, “ Net
Weight 6 Lbs. 8 Ozs.”, borne on the label, was false and misleading, and
in that the article was labeled so as to deceive and mislead the purchaser,
since the cans contained less than 6 pounds 8 ounces. Misbranding was alleged
for the further reason that the article was food in package form and the
quantity of the contents was not plainly and conspicuously marked on the
outside of the packages, since the statement made was incorrect.

On October 23, 1934, a plea of guilty was entered on behalf of the defendant
company, and the court imposed a fine of $400.

M. L. WiLson, Acting Secretary of Agriculture.
