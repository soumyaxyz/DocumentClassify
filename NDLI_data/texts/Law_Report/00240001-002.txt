D.O.No6(3) (72) /2001-LC (LS)
December 14, 2001

Dear Shri Jaitley,

I am glad to forward here with Law Commission’s 179" Report on “Public
Interest Disclosure Bill”.

The Law Commission had received a letter dated 24/8/1999 from Mr. N.Vittal,
the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) requesting the Commission to draft a Bill
encouraging to disclose corrupt practices on the part of public functionaries and
protecting honest persons from such disclosures. In this connection Shri. Vittal also made
reference to the speech of Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee condemning rampant
corruption and highlighting the principle of “Zero tolerance’.

Corruption has become a global malaise and for its eradication, “Whistle
Blowing” laws have been enacted by U.K., U.S.A. and Australia. Corrupt practices
violate human rights and basic freedom and affect the development of a Nation. The Law
Commission considered it necessary to recommend some measures to check this evil.

The 15" law Commission has already forwarded its 161“ report on ‘Central
Vigilance Commission and Allied Bodies’ in 1998 and 166" report on ‘The Corrupt
Public Servants (Forfeiture of Property) Bill’ in 1999 to tackle this problem.

The Commission after an in-depth study and taking into consideration similar
legislations in other countries and keeping in view the needs and circumstances of our
country has prepared this report. A Bill entitled “The Public Interest Disclosure
(Protection of Informers) Bill’ is enclosed with this report. (Annexure-I).

We hope the recommendations made by the Commission in this report will be
implemented to achieve the larger objective of checking corruption.

With warm regards,

Yours Sincerely,

(B.P. Jeevan Reddy)

Shri. Arun Jaitley,
Hon’ble Minister for law, Justice & Co. Affairs,
New Delhi.
