Ogden & Co.). Plea of guilty. Fine, $25 and costs. (F. & D. No.
17614. I. S. No, 4177-v.)

On August 23, 1928, the United States attorney for the Northern District of
Towa, acting upon a report by the Secretary of Agriculture, filed in the District
Court of the United States for said district an information against William L.
Ogden, trading as W. L. Ogden & Co., at Sioux City, Iowa, alleging shipment by
said defendant, in violation of the food and drugs act, on or about January 17,
1923, from the State of Iowa into the State of Illinois, of a quantity of frozen
eggs which were adulterated. The article was labeled in part: “ W. L. Ogden &
con * * Sioux City, Ia.’

Examination by the Bureau of Chemistry of this department showed a high
bacteria content in the article, with gas-forming organisms present in large
numbers. Physical examination showed that the product had an offensive and
putrid odor.

Aduiteration of the article was alleged in the information for the reason that
it consisted in whole or in part of a filthy and decomposed and putrid animal
substance.

On January 19, 1924, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the informa-
tion, and the court imposed a fine of $25 and costs.
