D.O. No. 6(3)(73)/2001-LC(LS)
Dear Shri Jaitley,

I am herewith forwarding the 178" Report containing
recommendations for amending various enactments, both civil and criminal.
Such a course was adopted in the Law Commission for the reason that there
are quite a few provisions in civil and criminal enactments which require
urgent attention and amendment. For example, amendment of several
provisions are called for in Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, Civil
Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code. If we take each of these
enactments for a comprehensive study and report, it would have taken a long
time whereas here are amendments which are urgent in nature. Moreover,
the Law Commission had prepared and sent a full report on Code of
Criminal Procedure as recently as 1996. The amendments recommended

herewith pertain to:

1) = Section 35, Stamp Act

2) Section 58(c), Transfer of Property Act

3) 0.20 R.12 and 0.20 R.18 of CPC

4) 0.34, CPC

5) â€” Section 69(2), Partnership Act

6) Section 306, Indian Succession Act & Section 166, Motor Vehicles
Act
