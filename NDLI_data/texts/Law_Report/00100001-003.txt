The theme of our Report is to maintain a balance between the liberty of
the citizens (the most precious of all fundamental rights) and the societal
interest in maintenance of peace and law and order. This is no doubt a
difficult balance but it has to be attempted, and achieved to the extent possible.
We have also taken note of certain important decisions of the Supreme Court
including the decisions in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. (1994) and D.K.
Basu (1997). Iam sure the Government will take these recommendations into
consideration and take steps for implementing them.

With warm regards,

Yours sincerely,

(B.P. Jeevan Reddy)
