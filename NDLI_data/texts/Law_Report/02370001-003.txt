This product was substandard because of the presence of excessive pits and
it was not labeled to indicate that it was substandard.

On or about November 80 and December 8, 1938, and January 7, 1939, the
United States attorneys for the Western District of Kentucky, Western District
of Oklahoma, and the District of Connecticut, acting upon reports by the
Secretary of Agriculture, filed in their respective district courts libels praying
Seizure and condemnation of 400 cases of canned cherries at Louisville, Ky.,
898 cases of canned cherries at Lawton, Okla., and 402 cases of canned cherries
at East Hartford, Conn.; alleging that the article had been shipped in interstate
commerce within the period from on or about August 8, 1938, to on or about
October 29, 1938, by H. C. Hemingway & Co. from Lockport, N. Y.; and charging
wnisbranding in violation of the Food and Drugs Act. The article was labeled
in part: “Schuyler [or “Cayuga”] Red Sour Pitted Cherries * * * Dis-
tributed by H. C. Hemingway & Co. Auburn * * * N. Y¥.”

It was alleged to be misbranded in that it was canned food and fell below
the standard of quality and condition promulgated by the Secretary of Agri-
culture, since there was present more than 1 cherry pit per 20 ounces of net
contents and its package or label did not bear a plain and conspicuous statement
prescribed by regulation of this Department indicating that it fell below such
standard.

On December 15, 1938, and January 16 and March 14, 1939, H. C. Hemingway
& Co., claimant, having admitted the allegations of the libels, judgments of
condemnation were entered and the product was ordered released under bond
conditioned that it be relabeled in compliance with the law.
