Directions for Inserting Seraps in Albums,
Applicable to Nos. O to 14.

The best method of mounting Phorocrarns in serap-albums is to paste
the edge nearest the binding or back part of the book (using very thick
boiled flowr-paste) so that the print may turn with the leaves. This is
easily done by laying the print on its face, and covering it with a sheet of
thick paper, leaving about one-sixteenth of an inch uneoyered, upon which
the paste is spread with the finger. The print is then assigned its proper
place in the book, indicated .by pencil-dots, and pressed down with thin
blotting-paper. If pasted across the leaf, or on the four corners, the
photograph will wrinkle in turning the leaves. It is best to employ very
thick paste, as this dries quickly, adheres firmly, and is less liable to cockle
than if it were thin and watery.

As unmounted photographs have a tendency to curl up towards the pict-
ure side, they should be rolled so as to enrl outward before being inserted
in the album. ‘This is done by gently drawing them across a tolerably
sharp edge, such as the edge of a drawer, one hand pressing lightly on the
photograph, until they are bent in the opposite direction.

lt is advisable to cover only one side of the leaf, as this will keep the
photograph from injury.
