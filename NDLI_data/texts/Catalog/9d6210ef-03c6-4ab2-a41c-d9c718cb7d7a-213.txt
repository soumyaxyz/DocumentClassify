Framing.

We have special facilities for framing photographs, and keep all the
latest styles of mouldings in stock.

We make a specialty of supplying framed pictures for gifts, and, where
the selection of the frame is left to us, we endeavor to adapt the frame to
the picture, and guarantee our work to be of the best, and prices as low as
first-class work can be supplied.

Many of the large and extra photographs look much better framed
without showing any margin. In this case a wider frame is used, and,
although it decreases the size of the picture, it strengthens its effect. Alt
heads and many figure subjects and landscapes look much better framed
in this way.

Mounting in Albums.

Where thin-leaved albums are used, such as our numbers 0 to 14, the
photos. are pasted in by one edge only.

Price, 8 cents each. $2.50 per hundred.

Where card-stock albums are used the photographs may be mounted
solidly or pasted all over. This is a difficult and trying operation, and
needs much practice to prevent the leaves from warping.

Price for 7 X 9 photos., or smaller, 4 cents each. $3.00 per hundred.
