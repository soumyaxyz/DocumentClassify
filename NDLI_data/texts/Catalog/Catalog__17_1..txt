Social Pain

Neuropsychological and Health

Implications of Loss and Exclusion

Edited by Geoff MacDonald and

Lauri A. Jensen-Campbell

This edited volume provides the first comprehensive,
multidisciplinary exploration of social pain, the experi-
ence of pain as a result of interpersonal rejection or loss. It examines the
subject from a neuroscience perspective, explores the implications of social
pain for functioning in interpersonal relationships, and examines social
pain from a biopsychosocial perspective in its consideration of the health
implications. The book concludes with an integrative review of these diverse
perspectives. © 2011. 258 PAGES. HARDCOVER.
