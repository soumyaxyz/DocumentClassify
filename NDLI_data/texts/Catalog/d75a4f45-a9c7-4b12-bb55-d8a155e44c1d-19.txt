89. We fear that the Civil Service.College cannot he opened till January
1878. Several of the subjects of study require apparatus, which under recent
orders may not be purchased in this country, and delay will ensue in obtaining
it through the India House. The scheme requires time to become known_
throughout the country, and parénts will object to change their sons’ college
in the middle of the academical year. The college classes for the present session
have more than half finished their course, and it would be inexpedient: to
disturb them. The details of the scheme would not suffer from ventilation in -
the newspapers, and useful amendments on our proposals may be brought
to notice. : ;
