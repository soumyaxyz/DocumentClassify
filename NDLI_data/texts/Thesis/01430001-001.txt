Acknowledgement

I wish to express my deep sense of gratitude to my thesis supervisor,
Professor Subhash C. Kochar, not only for the academic help that I have
received from him in the form of invaluable and illuminating advice and
encouragement throughout my study, but also for his kindness and other
personal qualities which greatly helped me in overcoming many difficulties,
and in keeping me in high spirits. But for the immeasurable amount of time
and energy spent by Professor Kochar for me, this thesis would not have
materialized.
