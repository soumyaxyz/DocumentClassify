100 nm

The SEM images show several layers of graphene stacked together. The SEM images of
the as-received natural flake graphite shows several platelets combining to form
agglomerates. The hexagonal pattern in the SAD image shows the six fold symmetry of
carbon atoms arranged in the graphene plane. This indicates good crystallinity of the
graphene sheet.
