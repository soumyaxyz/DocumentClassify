Experimental

> Here was used as an Evive| as an . Expandable graphite
was prepared at room temperature by mixing 16 ml of sulfuric acid (98%) and 1.5 ml
hydrogen peroxide(30%) with 6 gm of natural flake graphite (60 mesh) having 98%

purity.
The

prepared mixture was then before further heat treatment. Heat
treatment was performed by inserting a silica crucible containing the prepared
mixture inside a muffle furnace. Finally the resulting graphite preparation procedure
of expanded graphite compound was subjected to

)

At such a high temperature the intercalates trapped between the graphite layers
decompose and force the layers to separate. The expansion process cause an

. 100 ml acetone was then mixed with 1 gm of the
expanded graphite and sonicated in an ultrasonicator followed by simultaneous
heating at 80Â°C and magnetic stirring.
