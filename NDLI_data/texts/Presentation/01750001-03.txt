Abstract

Phase pure polycrystalline Bi,Fe,O, is prepared using the conventional solid
state reaction route. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals Bi,Fe,O, to possess an
orthorhombic crystal structure with space group ‘Pbam’. Optical
characterization confirms Bi,Fe,O, to be a direct band gap material with Eg ~
1.5 eV. Magnetization measurement shows compound to_ be
antiferromagnetic (AFM) with AFM transition temperature ~150 K. The
dielectric response of the compound was recorded in the temperature range
10-300 K with the probing frequency from 500 Hz-5 MHz. Here, we report
remarkable magnetic field tunable dielectric properties of polycrystalline
Bi,Fe,O, near its AFM transition temperature. Thus, Bi,Fe,O, can be further
stimulated for various other magnetic field sensors, multiple state memory
and other ferroelectric applications.
