Abstract: Geometrically frustrated systems have attracted considerable interest because the spin frustration leads to exceptionally rich physical properties ranging over spin-liquid, quantum phase
transition, anomalous large thermoelectric response and magnetoelectric (ME) properties. Recently, the spin-driven ferroelectricity due to triangular spin frustration has been observed in various
antiferromagnetic compounds Ni,V,0,, hexagonal RMnO,, CuCrO,, and AgCrO,. But the role of pentagon spin frustration on the spin driven ferroelectricity is poorly understood. Bi,Fe,O, belongs to rare class
of compounds where ferroelectricity is being observed due to spin frustration in pentagon symmetry. But the microscopic picture of pentagon spin frustration is still under debate. Here, we report the
preparation of magnetoelectric Bi,Fe,O, and Co doped Bi,Fe,O, by solid state route using bismuth oxide (Bi,O,), iron oxide (Fe,O,) and cobalt oxide (Co,0,). Our X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirm that
there is no change in crystal structure due to Co doping. Scanning Electron Microscopy image shows grain size increases due to doping which is in agreement with XRD analysis. From dielectric constant

measurement we _ conclude __that_ dielectric constant increases due to Co doping. UV-Visible plot shows due to Co doping band gap _ energy decreases.
