Introduction to OFDM

Disadvantages
@ Sensitive to frequency synchronization problems.
@ It is also sensitive to Doppler Shift.
@ The peak to average power ratio of OFDM is also very high.
@ High PAPR increases the complexity of ADC & DAC converters.
@ High PAPR reduces the power efficiency and battery life.
