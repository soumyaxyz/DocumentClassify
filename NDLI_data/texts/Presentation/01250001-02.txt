Abstract: The effects of thermal and solutal dispersion on natural
convection about an isothermal vertical cone with fixed apex half angle,
pointing downwards in a Newtonian fluid are analyzed. The non-linear
governing equations and their associated boundary conditions are initially
cast into dimensionless forms by local-similarity variables. The resulting
system of equations is then solved numerically. A parametric study of the
physical parameters involved in the problem is conducted, the results of
this parametric study are shown graphically and the physical aspects of the
problem are highlighted and discussed.
