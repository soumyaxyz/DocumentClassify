After its trek through the Internet, and any other networks, the message reaches
the destination e-mail server. The message is kept on the server until the
recipient asks to get their e-mail. Then from time to time, as the user runs their e-
mail program, they ask for any incoming e-mail messages waiting for them. The
e-mail program transfers or downloads the user's e-mail from the server to their
own computer. Then the user can read their messages. Alternatively, a user
might read their e-mail online with their ISP's services. Although it may seem like
a long and drawn out process, it is actually very fast and the actual transmission

route is immaterial to the users.

What are the basic functions of an e-mail? Reading, printing, saving, replying,
writing, attaching, sending, keeping and removing. The typical components of an
email are the text or body of the message, the recipient's address, the subject
