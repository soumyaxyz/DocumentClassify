Introduction

e Composite material is a multiphase material formed from a combination
of two or more materials that differ in composition or.form, which are
bonded together, but retaining their identities and properties... The outcome
of this composition is that the newly formed material has. superior
properties over the individual components.

e Composite material consists of two or more different materials, combining
together through a interface, to form a new material. This new material can
offer better properties which can not be offered by either of the constituent
materials separately.

@ Composites are comprised of two or more separate material, that when
combined lead to improved properties over the individual components.
