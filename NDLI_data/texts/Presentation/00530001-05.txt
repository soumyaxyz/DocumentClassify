Reporting Perspectives Common to all Levels of Enterprise

Function level: Reports being generated at the function level may be
consumed by users within a department or geographic location or region or
by decision makers at the corporate level. One needs to keep in mind the
target audience for the reports. The requirements will vary based on the
target audience. Departments such as HR, marketing, production, purchase,
accounting etc. will need specific standard reports to handle operational,
tactical, and strategic challenges. Reports could be produced in many
languages to meet global user needs.

Internal/external: Sometimes the consumers of reports may be external to
the enterprise. We are very familiar with the annual reports of
organizations. Correctness as well attractive presentation of the report is of
paramount importance.

Role-based: Today we are witnessing massive information overload. The
trend is to provide standard format of report to similar roles across the
enterprise, as they are likely to make similar decisions. For example, a sales
executive responsible for strategic accounts will need _â€” similar
information/facts for decision making irrespective of the country/ products
he/she handles.
