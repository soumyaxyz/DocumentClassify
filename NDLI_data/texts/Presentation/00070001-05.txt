Stress assisted Corrosion

A. A little bit of fracture mechanics

Questions of vital importance

Why does a material fracture?

Energy is the key : all processes tend to lower energies of systems. In fracture we consider two types of

energy

i. The elastic energy due to stress — this is reduced as a crack occurs in a body

ii. |The chemical energy of surfaces — this is increased as surfaces are created, that is, as cracking
occurs

The energy concept was first used by Griffith to explain the conditions for Brittle Failures.

His theory was modified by Orowan to include ductile materials.

How does a metal fracture?
The fracture mode depends on loading mode, on the materials inherent plastic properties, on the grain
boundary character

When does a material fracture?
When stress exceeds critical values, Temperature is conducive or Corrosion causes dissolution reducing
the effective load bearing capacity. Time is also a factor (ageing).

How to prevent fracture?

After knowing the “How” and “When” a material fractures, the obvious prevention methodology is to
eliminate or reduce the factors which accelerate fracture
