Introduction: Lonar lake, India [1, 2] is one of the
few known terrestrial asteroid impact craters that is
fully excavated in Deccan Trap basalts (~65 Ma) [3],
and thus comparable to those craters formed on rocky
planetary bodies in our Solar System having basaltic
crusts [4]. This simple, bowl-shaped, near-circular
impact crater has a diameter of ~1.8 km with an aver-
age rim height of ~30 m above the adjacent plains,
whereas the crater floor lies ~90 m below the pre-
impact surface [5]. The age of the crater is controver-
sial and could be ~52+6 [6] or 656+81 ka [7]. This
crater was formed by an oblique impact of a chondrite
that hit the pre-impact target at an angle bewteen 30-
45° from the east [8, 9]. Our preliminary observations
showed that the unshocked and shocked basalts from
Lonar significantly differ in their bulk-coercivity,
squareness of hysteresis, coercivity ratio, and low and
high temperature susceptibility measurements [10]. It
is also understood that anisotropy of magnetic suscep-
tibility (AMS) of unshocked and shocked target basalts
show systematic variations with reference to the direc-
tion of impact [9, 11]. In the present work, we report
variations in primary magnetization component be-
tween the unshocked and shocked target rocks of Lo-
nar crater and their relation to the direction of impact.

Sampling and experimental procedures: In the
Lonar area six basalt flows of ~8-40 m thickness have
been reported, the four bottom flows of which are only
exposed along the crater wall [12]. We have collected
oriented drill core samples of apparently unshocked
and shocked basalts from the top of fourth basalt flow;
the unshocked samples were collected from the base of
Durga Tegri at ~2 km ESE of Lonar crater rim and the
shocked basalt samples were collected from around the
crater rim [9].

The cylindrical samples of 2.54 cm diameter and 2
cm height obtained from drill cores were used for pa-
laeomagnetic measurements. The NRM was measured
by a Molspin spinner magnetometer. Alternating field
demagnetization (AFD) was performed up to 100 mT
with an average of 14 demagnetization steps using an
ASC D-2000 AF demagnetizer; magnetic remanence
after each demagnetization step was measured by an
AGICO JR-6 spinner magnetometer. The primary and
secondary magnetization components were derived
from these data by principal component analysis [13],
guided by visual inspection of orthogonal demagneti-
zation plots [14].

Primary magnetization: Our measurements on
the unshocked target basalt from the base of Durga

Tegri (n=12) show that the site-mean high-temperature
(HT) component (Fig. la) has a declination (Dn)=
194.1°, inclination (Im)= +65.9°, dos= 3.8°. This direc-
tion is, however, different from the data reported earli-
er (chron C29R; at Lonar D= 157.6°, I= +47.4°) [15,
16].

The HT component of most of the shocked basalts
(n=52) from around the Lonar crater rim are mostly
oriented toward the ESE to SSE (Fig. 1b) and have a
site-mean D,,= 117.9°, Im= +39.6°, dos= 4.6°, which are
similar to the published data of fourth basalt flow ex-
posed on the Lonar crater wall (D,= 126.4°, I=
+44.7°, dos= 4.1°) [17]. The HT direction for shocked
basalts from sourthern and southwestern crater rim,
however, are different. The shocked basalts (n=9) from
southern crater rim have contrasting NE orientation of
HT component and have a site-mean of D,= 51°, In=
+15.6°, dos= 16.1°. Those from the SW crater rim
(n=10) have the same orientation (SE) of site-mean HT
component but all inclinations are negative (D,=
117.3°, Im= -27.4°, Oos= 7.1).
