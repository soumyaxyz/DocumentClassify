Abstract

In this work we study the dynamics of squeezed states of light in Glauber-Fock
photonic lattices. The behaviour of squeezing is investigated for different transverse positions
of the squeezed state input. Our results show the revival and transfer of squeezing across the
waveguide array. We also analyse the quantum walk of correlated and anti-correlated path-
entangled photon states by studying the evolution of the coincidence rate at the output of the
waveguide. We consider both the cases of small and large size lattice. In the case of a large
lattice, we found that because of the quantum interference effect the dynamics of a separable
state is significantly different in comparison to the path-entangled input states. For the case of

small size lattice, we show the revival of the path-entangled input state.
