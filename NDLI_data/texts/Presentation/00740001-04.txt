Introduction to KMP Algorithm

 

* KMP is a pattern matching algorithm which is named after
its inventors Donald Knuth , James H. Morris and Vaughan
Pratt.

¢ This was conceived in 1974 and was formally published in 1977.
¢ Knuth , Morris and Pratt developed a method which keeps the
information gathered and never re-compares the symbols that have
matched in earlier.

* This methodology reduces the no. of comparisons w.r.t other
native approaches such as BruteForce, and achieves the running
time of O(m+n).

¢ It uses the pre-processing of the patterns to analyze its structure.

* It uses the concept of prefix and suffix in the pattern.
