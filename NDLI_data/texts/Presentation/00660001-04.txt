Binary Search Tree

 

= Binary search tree(BST) is a very important subclass of
binary trees.

= In binary trees data is not ordered in some logical order
But in BST, data is managed in such a logical way that it
can be retrieved efficiently when required.

*A binary search tree is a binary tree in which node
containing the data has the following constraints:

>Â» Each data element in the left subtree is less than
its root element.

> Each data element in the right subtree is greater
than or equal to its root element.

> Both the left and right subtree of the root will
be again a BST.
