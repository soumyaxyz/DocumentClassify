innovative by linking financial-marketing performance and how the metrics translate into
financial consequence. Srinivasan and Hanssens (2009) review the various financial metrics as
returns metrics and risk metrics. Srinivasan and Hanssens (2009) point out certain dependent
financial metrics such as firm valuation (Fornell et al, 2006), Tobin Q to measure firm value
(Simon and Sullivan, 1993), market-to-book ratio (Rao et al. 2004), stock returns (Srinivasan et
al, 2009), cash flow volatility (Gruca and Rego, 2005), systematic market volatility (McAlister et
al. 2007) and idiosyncratic volatility (Luo 2007; Osinga et al. 2009).

Rust et al., (2004) states that the
“Existing financial metrics have proven inadequate, leading to development and increasing use

of nonfinancial metrics”.

The quest of a comprehensive model has made marketing practitioners to cherry-pick metrics
beyond a dozen else, discard metrics that have been retained for internal purpose (Clark and
Ambler, 2011). There is a growing recognition of the need for non-financial metrics and forward
looking measures that can predict the future cash flows. Non-financial parameters such as brand
equity and customer equity bring value to the company once used in conjunction with the
financial metrics (Ambler and Roberts, 2008; Seggie, et al., 2007; Uzma, 2010). Research has
addressed the fact how non-financial marketing measures effectively drive financial performance
such as shareholder value (Rust et al., 2004). There are marketing literatures that incorporate
product quality (Aaker and Jacobson, 1994; Mizik and Jacobson 2003), customer loyalty
(Reinartz and Kumar, 2003; Kumar and Shah, 2004) and customer profitability (Jain and Singh,

2002; Gupta et al. 2004) as marketing measures.

Our framework is based on the four marketing measures; brand equity, customer equity,
customer satisfaction and customer lifetime value that are interlinked to the firm value.
Consequently, the framework establishes a link between the firm value and shareholder value.
For industries, longitudinal industry-level customer data are not available in India. Therefore,
companies must adopt primary research methods to collect information for measuring brand
equity and customers’ behavioural responses, which is an expensive and time taking process.

Thus, it becomes altogether more challenging for an individual researcher to carry out an
