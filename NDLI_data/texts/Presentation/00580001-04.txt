3.4 Circular Linked List

 

Linked List: A Linked List refers to a linear collection of data
elements in which linear order is not given by their physical
placement n memory (as in case of array). In linked list, the data
elements are managed by collection of nodes, where each node
contains link or pointer which points to the next node in the list. The
beginning f the linked list is maintained by a special pointer variable
which contains the address of the first node in the list. The link part of
the last node contains a special value called Null which shows the end
of the list.
