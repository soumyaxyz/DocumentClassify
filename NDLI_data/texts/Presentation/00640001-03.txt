Threaded Binary Tree

A binary tree with thread(s) is known as threaded binary tree. In a
threaded binary tree a know may contain pointer to its child node or
thread to some higher node in the node. The higher node to which
the thread points in the tree is determined according to the tree
traversal technique used (1.e. preorder, inorder, postorder).

There are three methods to apply thread binary tree. Each method
corresponds to a particular type of tree traversal:

Preorder threading: on this, the threads are applied to the higher
node containing the preorder traversal of the tree.

Inorder threading: the threads are applied considering the inorder
traversal.

Postorder threading: the thread are applied consider the postorder
tfaversal. ca
