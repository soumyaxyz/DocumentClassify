1.2 The Shear-flexible beam (Timoshenko)

In the classical Euler beam (meant only for thin
beams), it has been shown that despite the
presence of shear stress in the beam sections, the
shear strain is ignored.

The Euler beam is of infinite shear rigidity (!)

For thick beams (of wider webs), the Euler beam
theory is not valid. Shear deformation of the web
requires shear-flexible formulations.
