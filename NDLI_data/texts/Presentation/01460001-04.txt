Why Lead free

LI Lead (Pb) release into the environment at time of processing and remain for
a long time in the environment and accumulates in living tissues which
damages the brain and nervous system.

LU) It could introduce to the ecosystem and cause “acid rain”.

LI Restoring and recycling of lead-based materials is an extensive

environmental issues.
