Introduction

Ferrimagnetic Spinel ferrites are an important class of magnetic materials whose magnetic and electrical properties depend on the nature and
distribution of their cations in the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sublattices of a cubic structure. Most of the spinel ferrites are the derivatives of the
magnetite in that cobalt ferrite is a very important magnetic material which has covered a wide range of applications. Cobalt ferrite has inverse spinel
structure represented by (01-xF ex) A (CoxFe, x)pO4 where x Tepresents degree of j inversion, A represents tetragonal sites and B represents octahedral
sites. Present work concentrates on prepara tion of cobalt ferrite nanopd ticles DY rv ‘solge combustion method and study its IR ando ptical prop erties.

Particles exhibited a strong band edge around 400 nm. The band gap re 2.52 eV for the cobalt ferrite prepared using ethylene glycol and 2.64 eV
for the sample prepared using glycine, has been observed.

 

 

Conclusion:

By using glycine we have prepared cobalt ferrite pure phase but some impurity peaks are observed in the sample prepared using ethylene glycol. For
nitrate salts ae is better one ae to the SS oe From the FTIR it is clear is structure is ec and neers absorb some amount
