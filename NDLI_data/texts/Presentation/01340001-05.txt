Optimization of the chemical composition of nano-oxide dispersion
strengthened ferritic alloy in order to produce it without anisotropy.

Standardization of various operating parameters like milling time,
sintering temperature, atmosphere and holding time.

To study the distribution and the shape of the Yttria (Y,O,) dispersoid
on the ferritic matrix.

To study the effect of elements like Cr and nano-Yttria on the
microstructure and mechanical properties of ferritic alloys.
