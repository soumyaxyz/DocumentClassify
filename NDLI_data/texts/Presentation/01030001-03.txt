ELECTROCERAMICS — STRATEGIC MATERIALS IN THE QUEST TO SOLVE
THE ENERGY CRISIS

Electro-ceramics, combining stability (thermal, chemical), functional versatility
and low cost, represent the key materials candidates in many of the proposed
renewable energy solutions including solar photovoltaics, fuel cells/electrolyzers,
high energy density batteries, and thermoelectrics.

Ceramics

: derived from keramos :°

Greek word for potter's clay or ware made from clay and fired. (‘pottery’)
