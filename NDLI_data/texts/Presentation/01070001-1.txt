RESULT AND DISCUSSION

 

state erosion (Effect of impingement angle of erosion rate)

e variations of steady-state erosion rates of bamboo-epoxy and glass-epoxy composites
2d with red mud particulates with the angle of impingement are presented in Fig. 2. The
sion behavior of materials is broadly classified in the literature as ductile and brittle
pending on the variation of erosion rate with impact angle. Ductile behavior is
aracterized by maximum erosion at low impact angles in the range o f 10-30°. On the othe
nd, if maximum erosion occurs at a = 90°, then the behavior is brittle. However, reinforcec
mposites have been found to exhibit semi-ductile behavior with maximum erosion rate ai
ermediate angles typically in the range of 45-60° [1]. In the present study, the variation o
sion wear rate of the composites with impingement angle is studied by conductinc
periments under specified operating conditions. The result shows the peak erosion takin¢
ice at an impingement angle of 60° for the unfilled as well as the red mud (RM) anc
mina filled bamboo-epoxy composites, whereas composite samples filled with copper slag
