Abstract: Recessed-source/drain (Re-S/D) SOI MOSFETs are being researched in both academia and
industry because of its high drain current drive capability [1-2]. Fully depleted Re-S/D SOI MOSFETs
possess superior short channel immunity and near ideal subthreshold characteristics. In a Re-S/D SOI
MOSFET, source and drain are extended deeper into the buried oxide (BOX) in order to decrease the
series resistance. A number of attempts have been made to model the subthreshold characteristics of Re-
S/D SOI MOSFETs with undoped and uniformly doped channel for getting more physical insight [1-3].
However, the actual doping profile after the ion implantation step differs from uniform profile and
resembles much with the Gaussian profile [4]. In addition, the Gaussian profile in turn gives two more
parameters, projected range (R,) and straggle (o,), which can control the device characteristics.

In the present work, an attempt has been made to model the threshold voltage of Re-S/D SOI MOSFETs
with vertical Gaussian doping profile in the channel. The two dimensional (2D) Poisson’s equation has
been solved in the channel region of the device considering the appropriate boundary conditions. We have
adopted the so called “virtual cathode approach” for the threshold voltage modeling. The developed
analytical model predicts the threshold voltage of the device for wide variations in the device parameters.
To verify the accuracy of the present analytical model, the model results are compared by
ATLAS™ device simulator [5].
