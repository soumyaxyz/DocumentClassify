What everybody knows...

The Finite Element Method is a Numerical tool to solve
differential equations (approximately) through
discretization.

Steps of FEM

(1) Discretisation of the continuum into elements.

(2) Element formulation using approximate solution for the differential
equation.

(3) Element assembly.

(4) Solution of the system of equations, incorporating boundary
conditions.

Converge to more accurate results by using more
elements (i.e. through finer discretization).
