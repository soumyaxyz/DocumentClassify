Mining Waste

Heterogeneous geological material

May consist of sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous rock, soil and loose
sediments

Water, chemical, inorganic and organic additives

Mine wastes are problematic because they contain hazardous substances that can
be (or are) released into the environment around the mine — heavy metals,
radioactive elements, acids, process chemicals — and therefore require
treatment, secure disposal, and monitoring.

Wastes are not only produced during mining, but also at mineral processing
plants and smelter sites and include effluents, sludges, leached ore

residues, slags, furnace dusts, filter cakes and smelting residues.

Mine wastes may be in the form of: solid waste, water waste, or gaseous waste.
