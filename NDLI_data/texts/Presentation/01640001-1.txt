Abstract

Increasing industrialization and unsustainable use of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and toxic metals poses serious environmental pollution. Marine
environment serves as the highly dynamic milieu and the inhabitant microbes possess
de-novo potential in bioremediation. Use of biofilm-EPS (extracellular polymeric
substances) forming microorganisms from marine microbiota have enormous
metabolic potential for environmental clean-up. Many biofilm forming marine
bacteria; Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes, Escherichia, Vibrio
and Ochrobactrum have been isolated and characterized from Bay of Bengal, Odisha,
India. These isolates tolerate substantial level of PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene
and pyrene) and toxic metals (Hg and Cd).

Key words: biofilms, bioremediation, marine bacteria, PAHs, toxic metals
