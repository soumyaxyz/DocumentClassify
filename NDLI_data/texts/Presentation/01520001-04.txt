HRTEM and SAD image of expanded graphite

The TEM images suggest that the graphene sheets are highly transparent and has folded edges.
This also suggests that the layers have very small thickness. The hexagonal pattern in the SAD
image shows the six fold symmetry of carbon atoms arranged in the graphene plane. This
indicates good crystallinity of the graphene sheet.
