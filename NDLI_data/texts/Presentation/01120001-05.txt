Problem analysis

We consider the system of equations which governs the one
dimensional modified shallow water equations as follows [?]

hy + huy + uhy = 0,

up + gn Dh, + uu, = 0, (1)
where x, t are the independent variables denoting the space
and time respectively and

u = x-component of fluid velocity,
h = variable depth
g = acceleration due to gravity, H = ko/g.
