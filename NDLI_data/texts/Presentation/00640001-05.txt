One-way Threading

In this, a thread appears either in the right link field or in the left
link field of the node. Is the thread appears in the right link filed
of the node then points to the next node in the inorder traversal of
the tree 1.e. it points to the in order successor of the node. Such
tree is known as right threaded binary tree.

If the thread appears in the left link field of the node. It points to
the preceding node in the inorder traversal of the tree. Such a tree
is known as left threaded binary tree. As, the threading is done
according to the inorder traversal, hence the tree is referred as in-
threaded binary tree.
