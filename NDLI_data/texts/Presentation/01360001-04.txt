Why Al-AlO3?

-™ The system shows high stability at elevated temperatures.

"The system resists softening at high temperatures.

= Alumina does not react with matrix at high temperature and
does not create any undesired phase.

= The system has superior properties such as hardness,
fracture toughness as compared to the native material.

7 High thermal stability of alumina particles prevents the
particles from ripening and dissolving.

=Native aluminum’ Ss wear resistance is poor and alumina helps i in
enhancing the same.
