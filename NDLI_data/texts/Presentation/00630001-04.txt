Applications of Stack

 

The stack is used in wide variety of applications. These are
extensively used in system programming (compilers and
operating system)and application programming .

Evaluation of Arithmetic Expression

An important application of stack is the compilation of
arithmetic expression in the programming languages. The
compiler must be able to translate the expression which is
written in the usual notation known as infix notation to a
form which is known as reverse polish notation. Compilers
accomplish this task of notation conversion i.e. infix to
postfix with the help of stack.
