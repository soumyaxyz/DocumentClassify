Infix Notation

 

The most common notation that is used while expressing
arithmetic expression is infix notation. In this notation, operator is
placed between its operands. For example, to multiply m and n
we write m * n. It is the notation that is used by most of the
people to solve any mathematical/arithmetic expressions. But,
while solving the infix notation, the main consideration is the
precedence of the operators and their associativity. For example,
consider an expression,

e=q*rt+s
In this expression, following the precedence rules, q and r are first

multiplied and then s is added. That is, *(multiplication) operator
has precedence over the +(addition) operator.
