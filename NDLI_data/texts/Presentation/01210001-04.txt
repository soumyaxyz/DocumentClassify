FEM Terminology

 

Element A geometric sub-domain of the
region being simulated, with the property that
it allows a unique derivation of the
approximation (interpolation) functions.

Node A geometric location in the element
which plays a role in the derivation of the
interpolation functions and it is the point at
which solution is sought.

Mesh A collection of elements (or nodes) that
replaces the actual domain.

Weak Form An integral statement equivalent
to the governing equations and natural
boundary conditions.
