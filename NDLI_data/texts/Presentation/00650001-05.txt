Graph (continued)

 

 

Â°A graph may be pictorially represented as shown in the
figure:

In this graph, vertices are labeled
using letters a, b, c, d and e.
Therefore,
Vo ={a, b, c, d, e}
E,={ab , be, ed , de, ca, be , ad}
or
Eg={el, e2, e3, e4, e5, 6, e7}

In this graph, edge between two
vertices can be written in any
order. For example, the edge
between the vertices a and d can
be written as either ad or da.
