Joint Probability

e For events A and B, joint probability Pr(AB) stands
for the probability that both events happen.

e Example: A={HH}, B={HT, TH}, what is the joint
probability Pr(AB)?

e AB=null set so P(AB))=o

e Example: A={HH,HT}, B={HT, TH}, what is the
joint probability Pr(AB)?

e AB={HT} so P(AB))=1/4
