MOTIVATION

Copper has high electrical and thermal conductivities and good corrosion resistance at ambient temperatures but has poor mechanical properties such as
hardness and wear resistance.

Copper is used as electrical wires, cables, electrical busbars, circuits inter connectors, heat exchangers, heat sinks, etc., but some applications like electrical
contacts in switches necessitate the improvements in the mechanical properties without much loss of electrical and thermal conductivities to prevent
degradation due to frequent rubbing action.

Bulk modification/alloying improves the mechanical property but deteriorates the conductivity.

Surface modification can be another route to improve the surface mechanical properties (hardness, wear) by developing a hard/tough coating on the surface of
the component without affecting the bulk properties.

SCOPE

In the present study Cu-ultrafineTiO,/Al,O, nanocomposite coatings were developed by electro codeposition (electro and electrophoretic) with different process
variables like current density and Ti0,/AL,O, concentrations. After deposition different characterization techniques like XRD, EDS, SEM, microhardness testing
and (ball on plate) wear testing were carried out to study the properties of the coatings developed.

CONCLUSIONS

> In the present study TiO, and AL,O, powders individually dispersed in the Copper matrix by using Electrodeposition process.

> The particle size and iso electric points of TiO, and ALO, were 202 nm, 4.2 pH and 287 nm, 5.3 in pH respectively prior to deposition.

> A strong (220) intense diffraction line (texture) observed in most of the coatings developed, but obviously its intensity is effected by particle incorporation,
current density and Copper oxide formation.

> Coatings developed were smooth and without nodules, cracks and dendrites like structures.

> The amount of dispersed second phase particles greatly influenced by the concentration of powder in bath and Current density.

> At Current density 11A/dm2 higher hardness values were reported due to increased amount of dispersed second phase particles, texture and grain refinement.

> Wear resistance of composite coatings was improved with increase in amount of second phase particles and favorable texture.

> Electrical conductivity tests are going on
