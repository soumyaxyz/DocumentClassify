MINE ENVIRONMENT SYSTEM ANDITS EFFECT
ON MAN

Various types of pollution viz., air, water, noise are degrading the quality of
lives of miners by different means.

For example, water gets polluted due to increased concentration of toxic
metals in water, which welcomes the rise of various peculiar diseases. Days
have come to think about the pollutant released by the mining industries and
to think about the protection of minersâ€™ health through legislation and social
consciousness. Release of pollutants (especially toxic metals in water) and
their effects on human health are discussed.
