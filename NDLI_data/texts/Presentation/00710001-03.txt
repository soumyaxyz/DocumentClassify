DEFINITION

A Heap is co complete binary tree with n
elements which is maintained in the memory
using a linear array.

It is a very important data structure which can
be used efficiently to sort given list of elements.
There are two types of heaps:
If the value present in any node is greater
than all its children then such a tree is called
as the max-heap or descending heap.
In min-heap or ascending heap the value
oresent at any node is smaller than alll its
children.
