Assumptions

@ The flow is in steady state.

 
  
 
 
    

@ The flow is two-dimensional and laminar.
@ The fluid is incompressible and Viscous.

@ The porous medium have constant physical properties and are in local
thermodynamical equilibrium.

@ The flow is moderate, so pressure drop is proportional to the linear
combination of fluid velocity and the square of the velocity.

In addition, the Soret and Dufour effects are considered.
