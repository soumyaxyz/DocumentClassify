ABSTRACT

Environmental awareness today is motivating the researchers worldwide on the
studies of natural fibre reinforced polymer composite as cost effective option to synthetic
fibre. The easy availability of natural fibres and manufacturing process have tempted
researchers to try locally available inexpensive fibres and to study their feasibility of
reinforcement purposes and to what extent they satisfy the required specifications of good
reinforced polymer composite for tribological applications. With this background in this
present work the effect of stacking sequence on erosive wear behaviour of untreated luffa
cylindrica fibre and glass fabric reinforced epoxy hybrid composites has been investigated
experimentally. Composite laminates were fabricated by hand lay-up technique. All the
composites were made with a total of 4 plies, by varying the number and position of glass
layers so as to obtain five different stacking sequences. The erosion rates of these composites
have been evaluated at different impingement angles (30°,45°,60°,90°) and at four different
particle speeds (v=48, 70, 82,109 m/s). Silica sand with size 200-250 um of irregular shapes
is used as erodent. The impingement angle was found to have a significant influence on the
erosion rate. The composite laminate showed semi ductile behaviour with maximum erosion
at 45-60° impingement angles. The Factograpic analysis of the eroded surface was examined
by SEM. From the study it is concluded that the erosive wear behaviour of natural fibre luffa-

cylindrica can be improved significantly by hybridizing with synthetic fibre glass.
