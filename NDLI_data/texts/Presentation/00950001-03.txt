“The power (in a set-theoretic sense) of our thinking and feeling is much
higher than the power of living language. If in turn we compare the power of a
living language with the logical language, then we will find that logic is even
poorer.” — Zimmermann

¢ Expressing any natural phenomenon by mathematical expressions does not
always guarantee exact capturing of the phenomenon itself:

¢ If any phenomenon, especially related to human decision making can be
expressed linguistically chance of proper capturing of the phenomenon
increases.

* Fuzzy logic is a logic based on approximate reasoning and can be
expressed linguistically to capture the inherent vagueness of human mind;
thus, it can be applied to the areas which involve human decision making
like supervision, monitoring, planning, scheduling etc.
